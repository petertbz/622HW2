If this isa biweekly check, you'd be putting 36k a year into the 401k (26*1400). The limit for 401k contributions is actually about $24k so if you keep contributing at this rate, then you'll hit the max in the fall and the rest of your paychecks will be larger because you won't be contributing to the 401k the rest of the year.

If you're able to live this way, I recommend changing your traditional 401k to a roth 401k. Some people say to reap the tax benefit now, but odds are when you're retired your income is going to be be even higher, so may as well pay the taxes now and get the tax-free income later.

Otherwise, if you want more flexibility in your spending, I would reduce your contributions so you're fully funded by December, and not August. This will give you a bit of breathability, and whatever you have leftover can go into more traditional investments.","14"
