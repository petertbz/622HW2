Recently, a contact from a company I regularly work with contacted me enquiring if I happen to know somebody who is selling a specif asset from the industry I'm in.

After making a few phone calls, I happened to find another contact, who I also regularly work with, that is selling such asset and who gave me the price he wants for said asset. 
We are talking about something ranging six figures.

If I now introduce/link these two contacts together, can I expect to get any cut from them? If yes, what percentage would we be talking about? 

Alternatively, would it be appropiate to add a percentage by myself to the already given price for such asset? If yes, what percentage should it be? (then I'd obviously no longer except a cut, but I'd obviously have to tell the eprsonwho is selling the asset this before introducing them to each other). 

Or, alternatively, should I not do any of the above and simply see what the contacts offer me for being the middleman once/if the deal goes through? 

I would merely link them together, not act as a broker. 

Thank you! ","business",4,4,0,0.75,0,0,0,3

March 21 (Reuters) - Pemex's Deer Park, Texas, facility reported an oil spill into the Houston ship channel on Thursday, the refiner said in a community alert, adding it had isolated the site and deployed booms to contain the leak.  
""The oil had reportedly overflowed from a sump at the Pemex refinery in Deer Park,"" the U.S. Coast Guard said in an emailed statement, adding the cleanup is complete.  
""Personnel at the refinery shut down the system, placed a boom to protect the area and applied absorbent materials to clean up the oil,"" the Coast Guard said.

This allows users to upload company documents and the AI creates a series of interactive functions from this including a course, quizzes and assessments. We also create  roleplay training for staff engaged with email and live chat providing real world scenarios.
This was initially built on no-code and we attracted a large, national tourist board who paid upfront so we built this out in code. This has led to more in the niche but now I'd like to roll this out more as a SAAS. 
Question is pricing - how do you approach this?
Our model was set up for initially to be a monthly fee of around $195 with a setup cost of $499. 
The tangible benefits are significant to any HR dept or any business who even employs a few members of staff. Reflecting this in the pricing whilst making it a no brainer is the key.","business",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1

Without sharing too many details, I tend to overthink past business decisions a lot. Like, I would sit down and think about the way I spoke with customers, read over messages to ensure they're no grammatical errors (even after I've sent them) and just in general just overthink everything in the business. Calls, messages, the way our back-end organisation is... everything!
