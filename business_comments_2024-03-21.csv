Developers make more on the App Store than any other mobile platform.  Pretty much everyone who has an iPhone loves it. And rival phone makers are just fine as Android based phones as a whole has significantly more market share than iPhone.

That said theres definitely some valid points about restrictions on apps they let in the App Store and things like that. But some of their examples are bad.  For example alternative nfc payment processors - if you want to use Android pay get an Android phone.","2"

Almost as if between Apple dictating certain prices and limiting access to the market has a negative impact on competition and the prices consumers potentially pay?

I don't know if that's actually the case, but that's likely how a prosecutor approaching this from the standpoint of an antitrust case would look at it.","2_1"

Also not allowing (some) competing apps to be included on the App Store.  As long as the apps follow apples strict security measures most of them should be fine. 

Developers can set their own price and people with iPhones are more likely to actually pay for apps than Android users.

However we know they will sometimes pressure apps, or music publishers, or other people that want to sell on their marketplace to meet certain price points or standards or make certain additional contractual agreements. 

The thing about antitrust is that no one thing Apple did has to meet the strictest definition of monopoly or antitrust to successfully prosecute a pattern of ""close enough"" behavior as an effective monopoly or antitrust violation.

The laws are trying to prevent certain marketplace behavior where there are countless distinct and different ways of arriving at that same point.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Developers can set their own price and people with iPhones are more likely to actually pay for apps than Android users.

Right. Again I'm not saying this is actually the case, its just an example of why that might not be seen as favorable to Apple's defense. If Apple can effectively ""choose winners"" by giving preferential access to the market, or excluding apps from its market place, the fact developers can set their own price can just as easily be evidence of how much preferential treatment or how much Apple choosing not to allow a particular app on its store can impact competition, since it's far easier to raise prices the less competition there is.

In many instances Apple not only gets something for licensing development tools, apps being on the store, for processing payments, but they will often times negotiate profit sharing or other means of getting more residuals from developers beyond what might be immediately apparent. This gives them incentive to not just promote partners but to protect them from anything that might reduce those partner's profits. So it becomes a question of how farApple throws its weight around in all regards. Each one of those things might be perfectly fine, but doing them all together may well be legally problematic.","2_1_1_1"

It's a question of whether uses its unique position in a market to assert unfair influence on that market.

Examples of unfair influences could be everything from dictating who can participate in a market or dictating the pricing of the products of their competition to have market access or dictating the form of payment processing their competition with in the market can use.

They get a lot of latitude because they produce the hardware and have a say in compatibility. But there have been a number of decisions they've been able to make that they simply couldn't have if they didn't have some degree of monopolistic influence.

For example its believed Apple made certain changes to its devices just to make it harder for payment processing devices like Square to work with their devices, so they could promote their own payment processing. If for the sake of argument that were true, it's a decision not to improve the hardware but to neuter it and use its influence in one area of the market to undermine competition in another, which far more reaching than directly competing in a market place. Even if this doesn't rise to the level of an antitrust violation on its own, a pattern of monopoly-like behavior is enough evidence that they have an unfair influence in the market.","3_1_1"

But Microsoft are doing exactly the same thing with Microsoft Teams right now as they did back then.

There are levels where these activities are allowed. 

Apples App store is however just a full monopoly, and it has only been allowed due to firstly it being a relatively new market, and secondly formally there being Android, Windows Phone, and others competing. These have narrowed down to Android and Apple, and in America, Android is arguably even losing to Apple with no access to the space other than through the Apple store.

A monopoly is a market structure characterized by a single seller or producer that excludes viable competition from providing the same product.

To your example of Internet Explorer and Microsoft specifically, although originally the court ruled that Microsoft should be ""broken up"" as an illegal monopoly the case was ultimately appealed and settled with Microsoft agreeing to change some of its business practices.

To make things a no brainer you may want to consider having a value ladder in your sales and pricing process. So you would want to create lower price points that would allow ppl to sample the tech so they can feel the results and benefits and then sell them on a higher priced situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

From the consumer end it feels the best when there is a low ticket option that is super inexpensive to try things out (this becomes a marketing tool). A mid tier option to get a sample of what the high ticket item is like and also create a comfortable experience in your brand (goal of this is word of mouth growth and to make the sales process to your high ticket option smoother).

&amp;#x200B;

When doing this you can always raise the price of the high ticket solution and adjust the mid ticket solution so that ppl feel the impact and then want to buy after they get the sensation of what your technology can do for them.","1"
