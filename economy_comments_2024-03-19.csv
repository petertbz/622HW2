&gt;Only 44% of Americans surveyed said they **could** use their savings to pay for an unexpected expense

So lets read the underlying report.
&gt;Many would borrow in an emergency. Only 44% of U.S. adults **would** pay an emergency expense of $1,000 or more from their savings, as of December 2023 polling. 35% would borrow money, including 21% who would finance with a credit card 

There is a big difference between ""could"" and ""would"".   Now seeing that I am getting ""Low Current Balance Alert"" from my credit union, I'm not particularly liquid at this time, but I would be by the time my credit card that I would use for the $1000 expense is due.  

The credit card is my emergency funding source.   
(The reason for that low balance message is because the credit union insults my intelligence with their low interest rates.)","3"

I'm saying that the economic environment results in it making sense to use a credit card as the primary source of emergency funds.   That is why the distinction between ""could"" and ""would"" is relevant.  This attempt to lump in the ""woulds"" with the ""coulds"" illustrates the state that journalism has gotten itself into.   

I ""wouldn't"" use debit because federal price controls makes it economically stupid to carry large balances at banks, but I easily could maintain a $1000 balance at the bank, or a $10,000 balance, or a $100,000 balance.   But because of the interest rate situation, it is extremely stupid to do so.  If they were paying 5¼% interest on savings accounts like the old days, there would be $1000 sitting in the bank tomorrow.   

I haven't paid an interest charge on my credit card in 20 years.  And I get cash back.   That's why I'm a ""would"" and not a ""could"".","3_1_1"

Why would I have debit at an institution that pays a negative ""real"" interest rate?  That's how you fall behind.   The only stat that matters is, what percentage would need to borrow to pay that $1000 charge and *incur interest charges*?  Way I would do it, I punch up $1k on the credit card, and it is an interest free loan so long as I pay it the following month.   I could sell some GLD to do it.   Anyhow, as soon as my tax refund hits, I'll have over $1k debit.  I *would* still use a no interest if paid in full credit card even if I *could* use debit.   

This is the relevant stat.
&gt;More than one-third (36 percent) of U.S. adults have more credit card debt than emergency savings.

So I used the credit card and didn't even bother to bounce 700 from one of our savings or high yield savings accounts to immediately pay it back off.

Part of the attractiveness of key indicators is that we can come to a broad conclusion about something looking at one indicator. However, one algorithm isn't going to give you a *conclusive* idea about the overall state of anything.

This isn't a condemnation of any one methodology vs another, but it is a cautionary note to look at several other indicators along with ANY one single indicator to gain a more holistic glimpse of what a key indicator may be suggesting and how valid it may be.

Consumer baskets vary with geography and time; what consumers bought 30 years ago may not be the same as what they buy today.","1_1_3"

But if housing takes more of your paycheck than ever and your credit card and car payments are up due to higher interest rates, it can feel very inflationary even if CPI doesn't reflect it.

Politicians look at U3 because it looks the best so it is taken as gospel, but you and I know that there are 5 other measures we should look at to get the best take. 

As you said, if we really want to understand how people are doing, we should be looking at disposable income AFTER autonomous consumption. 

Then overlay that with consumer debt and loan delinquencies and CPI or whatever measure you judge to be the best.  But we do not do that because that would be bad news. 

I think an ideal graph would contain all of those components so people could weigh these things and develop their own conclusions. 

Many times in my professional life, I would convey  bad news with graphs with several metrics because if I made a case for something on one principal, then my take on it would be more susceptible to what others perceived as my bias or misinterpretation. 

There is the reality of political economy in economic measurements. So by using several measurements, you essentially spread the risk of you being perceived as trying to garner political economy for a specific point of view.

This is what has happened here, even though that was not your intent at all because you were just conveying some information in good faith.","1_1_3_1_1"

Insurance? It's the devil's favorite tool. Got something nice, be a shame if something happened to it. Here buy insurance and you'll never see that money again.

Millions of Americans have signed a contract during their hiring that says if they boycott Israel they give up their job. In 37 states an oath of loyalty to Israel is a requirement for a government job or to work as a government contractor.

You can boycott all the other stuff, no problem, but if you stop buying Israeli goods, even accidentally, you could be in violation of your oath of loyalty and lose your job.

If you're going to boycott something, and you live in one of [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-BDS_laws#/media/File:Antibds_laws.png) states, please check that it isn't made in Israel, first, so you don't get in legal trouble.

In case you haven't seen the news, Israel is not fucking around these days. It takes 5 seconds to check where something is made. Don't lose your job over this.

Edit: I'm just trying to help people understand the law. Here in Indiana we've had loyalty to Israel laws since 2016. The state is required by law to maintain a blacklist of individuals and entities that boycott Israel. Some lawmakers tried to change the law recently to make it more about anti-semitism instead of loyalty to Israel but the governor vetoed the change yesterday.","29"

the US economy? Doesn't exist because it's not fair to all the players.

It's not considered an economy imo. players that enable other players to become rich in an economy and scam other players to benefit themselves without punishment isn't an economy. that's just called being evil and stealing. if another player can steal from a poor player, poor player is allowed to steal from rich player. to be a functioning economy is to follow strict laws and rules that protect and apply to each player regardless of society status, family name, etc

an economy that is pay to win at life isn't an economy. many top players today, pay to win and stay indefinitely. 

capitalism, social, comm, imp, etc? all economic systems are better if designed impartial and fair to every player, that is what we want

But it discontinued or gave timelines for ending purchases of real estate investment trusts and other assets.

The ultra-lax monetary policy that Uedas predecessor, Haruhiko Kuroda, put in place more than a decade ago was designed to establish what he called a virtuous cycle of inflationary expectations that would lead people to spend more both because borrowing costs were low and because they feared prices would rise in the future.

In regards to Israel, I would agree with you. AIPAC is an extremely powerful lobby, many Jewish politicians are dual citizens, and many evangelical Christians in America believe in Christian Zionism which is essentially supportive of the state of Israel. 

However, the Russia Ukraine thing is much different. Much of America is actually Russophobia due to the long Cold War which is indelible in the minds of Boomers as much as Christian Zionism is. Its unquestionable to them that Israel is good and Russia is bad. 

I highly doubt Russia has anywhere near as much political power in the U.S. to actually be a significant reason as to why the legislation for providing support to Ukraine is held up. There is a genuine feeling of resent meant in many Americans that the administration is characterizing Russia-Ukraine war as a threat to our security but exacerbating the problem at the Southern Border. You may disagree with that assessment and thats fine. However, it is a legitimate good faith belief by many Americans. How do I know? Because I share it. I say this as someone who in their professional capacity is deeply involved with providing the material assistance to Ukraine from the DOD.  

The final aspect of the Russia-Ukraine issue is that there is not really any conceivable scenario where Ukraine actually wins. Another hard to swallow pill but it is the truth. Theres a mix of reasons why and the holdup of aid right now probably isnt in the top 5. The biggest issues are manpower, air superiority, integration, and mass.

To provide you an example. Ill use fake numbers to just illustrate the problem and not get close to real data. Say Ukraine has 100 artillery pieces. They have roughly 50 in 155mm donated from NATO and 50 in 152mm which are what they started the war with from their Soviet times. Even if the west gives them near unlimited 155mm rounds they will still only be firing 50 guns at any given time. Its incredibly hard for the west to get any 152mm ammunition because many dont actually make it and those who do arent exactly friendly to us (Russia, China, NK, Iran). Now lets say Russia has 200 or 250 artillery pieces. They can fire nearly all pieces all day because they dont have the same integration issues of 155mm that Ukraine does. Ukraine will never be able to keep up with volume of fire. 

I could go on and on in regards to air supremacy, lessened utility of armor, drone usage, etc. 

With that known, why should the US pour hundreds of billions into a loss? Sure, it hurts Russia but its also dragging on a war that if it isnt negotiated to a close soon may see a total collapse of the UAF which would result in the complete seizure of Ukraine as opposed to maybe just Donbas if negotiated. 

I hope that clears things up for you as to why these are very very different things.","1"

It essentially combines the significance of the stock movements when a report is released, with the correlation it has with cool &amp; hot inflation  
The math behind it:  
For each inflation report released since Jan of 2022, I recorded if the reported inflation was above or below the consensus. Then, I calculated the returns of the stock on those days that the inflation reports were published. I then converted the percent returns to movements measured in standard deviations. Then, I compiled the average movements in STD DEVS for the times when reported inflation was -0.3 , -0.2 , -0.1, 0.1 , 0.2, and 0.3 percentage points below/above the consensus. Then, I measured the Reactivity taking the average of all the movements when inflation was below/above the consensus. This is how much (in standard deviations) a stock will move on average when inflation is below/ above the consensus. Then, I found the correlation (R\^2) that the movements had with the degree to which the inflation was above/below. In theory, a stock with complete influence from inflation should have a perfect linear relation (Losing more when inflation is hot, gaining more when inflation is cool, or perfectly vice versa). By then multiplying the R\^2 by the Reactivity, the Influence is found. This metric essentially means the degree to which this stock will react to an above/below consensus inflation report in a linear and predictable manner.

Whether it's good or bad depends entirely on whether the credit is used to increase aggregate supply or aggregate demand.

For example, let's say a local shoemaker gives the baker down the street a pair of new shoes on credit. They're old friends, the baker fell on hard times due to a grain shortage, and the shoemaker knows the baker is good for it and is happy to help him out because he knows it's a tough time.

That would be neutral or even beneficial.

Now let's say it's ten years down the road, the grain shortage is over, and the baker is doing booming business. He needs to expand his operation by installing more ovens. The guy down the street who makes the ovens advances him said ovens, and the baker pays him back over time with interest.

So that neutral creation of credit got the baker through the rough times and now he's using credit to increase aggregate supply.

Where things go off the rails is when credit is misused/abused to increase aggregate demand without increasing aggregate supply. Like if someone takes out a loan to buy a new car they can't really afford just because they want their neighbors to think they're rich.

Whenever you use credit, you're artificially increasing the money supply to buy something you actually can't afford. Since money is representative of goods and services, you're basically trading your future labor output for current goods and services. If you use the borrowed money to increase your output (like the baker buying more ovens), then you've used credit responsibly. But if you use it in ways that undermine your future output, like making irresponsible purchases, then you've undermined the entire economy by printing money that won't be met by a proportional increase in supply.

When you get lots of people using credit irresponsibly, the supply of money goes up faster than the supply of goods and services, and that's what destroys economies and currencies. Unfortunately, human nature being what it is, you can always count on it. Every economy and every currency will end up being destroyed in the end by consumer greed. That's why we get credit cycles and related boom bust cycles, and that's why people who understand that basic principle can consistently make money in the markets.","1"

My concern or outlook is, the cost of living is rising well above the average wages and income.

You know, out of the dozens of people I've explained this to, you might be the only person who actually understood any of it. I've tried to explain it to random people online, friends and family (to warn them what's about to happen), and nobody even begins to get it.

As for how much longer it can continue, I don't know. Considering we're at the point now where people are literally financing cups of coffee, I have to think the end is near. But whether that's next week or a decade from now, I don't know. Nobody does. People in the early 1980s thought the end of the dollar was then, and then China opened to the west and created a whole new market for US debt.

The wildcard right now is immigration. If we can import enough warm bodies into our economy, we can increase GDP, increase demand for goods and services, and, eventually, increase demand for new loans. It seems the plan is to get these fresh immigrants into the military and rapidly transform them into debt slaves, which could hypothetically work, if it's done on a large enough scale and rapidly enough.

We need to expand the money supply by about ten trillion dollars practically overnight. That would stop the deflation in money supply and get the economy growing again, bring interest rates back down, and the newly minted Americans would create enough demand to keep the currently saturated debt slaves employed. And we would get to survive another few years, perhaps even a decade or more.

I doubt it's going to work with 100% success. I imagine the reality will land somewhere between abysmal failure and spectacular success. So maybe recession but not all out deflationary death spiral resulting in the debt bubble completely bursting.

I think its kind of hard to grasp overall just how capitalism and the economy truly works. Most people understand the basic premises but dont really analyze whats going on or how money moves or works (especially when talking inflation, credit, interest, debts, and tax rates). It seems simple but factoring in over expenditure, debts like never before seen, cost of living rising well above average wages, and how people are financing basic things, the way it all comes together can be a little mind boggling or hard to understand. Speaking for myself, just coming up with these questions, it truly starts to make less sense to me how any of it works in reality. 

I know In principle (like the example you gave with the shoemaker and the baker) that it makes more sense, but we know thats not how it truly is working on the grand scale. The elites and the powers that be always used financing and debt to give the average person spending power and ability to obtain goods, services, vehicles, and property, but what if these debts get to proportions (such as student loan debt) where its almost unimaginable that all of that can be paid back. Im saying that as a rhetorical question. I know I basically asked that in a number of different ways already, but its just really interesting to me the way the economy is going and how it all works. The mass amount of debt the average person takes on is something that scares me.

One of my assessments is that the rich or elite class of today are far greedier then ever before and they keep allowing (like weve always) the average person to take on financing and debt at higher levels (student loans example) to appear as if profits or money flow is generating upwards in profits. However I think its creating a vortex to where so much of it is on credit/financing that they over extended there hand in giving out money, and the average American is over extended in ever being able to pay that off while also having a family, shelter, and basic needs. (Including all overall debts here). That in turn is going to create a burst at some point I think when it overlaps and people can no longer even sustain themselves alongside the debt. There only options would to just take on more debt which eventually has to reach a breaking point. I hope this made somewhat sense.","1_1_1_1_1_1"

That means all monetary systems are inherently ponzi schemes.

This is unavoidable. It's unavoidable because you can't stop people from creating credit. Like the government could ban banks and ban lending, but they can't stop people from loaning each other money or fronting them goods and services for interest. I mean look at the entire illicit drug trade, that's how it works, and they obviously can't stop it. So credit is an unavoidable part of any economy. You can't stop it, and you can't stop people from being stupid with it.

Now the degree to which the system can get out of control can be limited. Like before the creation of the federal reserve, there was a very minor (by today's standards) boom bust cycle every five to ten years. It's trying to prevent these boom bust cycles that is really the greatest evil in our economy. Doing everything they can to keep kicking the can down the road.

The boom bust cycles are necessary to reset the credit and prevent hyperbubbles from forming. Honestly, I think the answer is really imposing busts vs trying to prevent them. Have a jubilee every so often like the Jews used to. It's interesting their debt jubilees came every seven years, and it was every five to ten years that we had a bust in a more organic economy before central banking took over.","1_1_1_1_1_1_1"

There's a reason governments spend so many taxpayer dollars digging their economies out of recessions. Families lose their homes. Children go malnourished. New grads spend years struggling to get their careers back on track, forgoing marriage and kids and homeownership. But a growing body of research suggests that recessions are good for at least one thing: longevity. Puzzlingly, it appears that economic downturns actually extend people's lives.

The latest evidence comes from ""[Lives vs. Livelihoods](https://www.nber.org/papers/w32110),"" a new paper by four researchers led by the renowned health economist Amy Finkelstein. They found that during the Great Recession, from 2007 to 2009, age-adjusted mortality rates among Americans dropped 0.5% for every jump of 1 percentage point in an area's unemployment rate. The more joblessness, the longer people lived  especially adults over 64 and those without a college education.

""These mortality reductions appear immediately,"" the economists concluded, ""and they persist for at least 10 years."" The effects were so large that the recession effectively provided 4% of all 55-year-olds with an extra year of life. And in states that saw big jumps in unemployment, people were more likely to report being in excellent health. Recessions, it would seem, help us stay fitter, and live longer.

The question, of course, is why. The economists ruled out a lot of possible explanations. Laid-off workers weren't using their free time to exercise more, or cutting back on smoking or drinking because money was tight. Infectious diseases like influenza and pneumonia kept right on spreading, even though fewer people were going to work and dining out. Retirees didn't seem to be getting better care, even though rising unemployment rates made it easier for nursing homes to staff up. So what could the explanation be? How does higher unemployment lead to longer life?

The answer was pollution. Counties that experienced the biggest job losses in the Great Recession, the economists found, also saw the largest declines in air pollution, as measured by levels of the fine particulate matter PM2.5. It makes sense: During recessions, fewer people drive to work. Factories and offices slow down, and people cut back on their own energy use to save money. All that reduced activity leads to cleaner air. That would explain why workers without a college degree enjoyed the biggest drops in mortality: People with low-wage jobs tend to live in neighborhoods with more environmental toxins. It would also explain why the recession reduced mortality from heart disease, suicide, and car crashes  causes of death all linked to the physical and mental effects of PM2.5. Overall, the economists found, cleaner air was responsible for more than a third of the decline in mortality during the Great Recession.","1"
