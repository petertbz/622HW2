Some days I feel like income wise I am ok, but other days I feel like I dont make enough when I hear what everyone else in my family makes. Im able to support myself alone as a single 28 year old on 60k.  Vehicle paid off, student loans paid off, $70k brokerage account, $20k 401k, $8k checking.  Im fortunate to have the savings that I do, due to past employers putting me in free housing (allowed me to save save save), however, I live in the Greater Phoenix metro and I feel like compared to others, its really not that much.  Are others able to live on this income in a HCOL area long-term? I like my job and my boss and want to stay long-term, but I am not expecting more than a 5% raise annually. So just want to know if $60-70k is sustainable long-term?","Salary",6,6,0,0.88,0,0,0,12

I have surpassed my peers and am well know across departments for the quality of work and positive relationships.

I seem to have set a standard of high quality work but am not getting compensated for it. I have a lot of schedule flexibility and think very highly of my leader.

Im feeling burnt out and would like to ask for a raise, but dont know how to handle the conversation. 

Company wide, staff get annual cost of living increase and an annual bonus of 1-3%.

I aways get top review scores and accolades,
I know I am valued, but cant sustain the amount and quality of work at the pay rate I am getting. 

I also suspect I am the lowest paid on my team of 4 because Ive been in the industry the shortest amount of time. Yet I carry the burden of the work. 

Help!

I started in IT reselling on eBay on the side. That got my foot in the door in a marketing department and I eventually learned Amazon, Walmart, Target, etc. My main focus now is Amazon. I have an associates in applied science focusing on information systems.

Here's my salary over the years:  


**IT Focus**  
IT Intern $12/hr - 2016-2018 | Left because I was told I can't move up unless I get my bachelors degree  
IT Support $15/hr - 2018 | Left because the job was extremely unsafe, working in a mining facility under MSHA  


**Marketing Focus (focus on Amazon Vendor Central, Seller Central, &amp; Other marketplaces)**  
Marketing Support - $18/hr - 2019 -| Stayed at this rate for 1.5 years. Wanted more money so I found a new job and served my two weeks notice unless they could increase my rate  
Marketing Support 2 - $24/hr - 2019-2021 | Stayed at this rate for 2 years. I wanted more money and knew they company would never give it to me.  
Account Manager - $45/hr + 5% bonus - 2022 | I applied for jobs for months. I usually do well in interviews, the hard part was getting the interviews. My resume doesn't get looked at more often than not because of my AAS. Most want bachelors / MBA for this type of work | I left because this was a horrible company to work for, fired 30+ people over email my 2nd week. I was only here for 4 months. Crushed it but a better opportunity fell in my lap  
Sales Director - $60/hr + 10-20% bonus - 2022-current | I applied out of chance. 300+ applicants. Hit easy apply and the president of the company reached out to me within 10 minutes. Long story short, 3 weeks later I was employed at the company.  


My biggest piece of advice is to have confidence. Most people second guess themselves so much that they will never put themselves in a situation where they can massively level up. When I jumped from $24/hr to $45/hr it took me over 500 applications, potentially over 1,000. I am 27 now and have been competing against applicants who are in their late 30's early 40's. I win because I have ambition, high energy, confidence, and competence. Anyone can be a ""visionary"", what's helped me is being someone who understands that, but knows how to do the nitty gritty. I think that IT and Marketing go hand in hand and can make a deadly combo. I can run circles around most people in marketing because they lack an understanding of technology. 

For those with no / little education, you can do it! Education is a tiny blurb on my resume, I post about my experience and my achievements. It's about how you market yourself. Have confidence and other will believe in you. Don't sell yourself short, when I was a janitor we called ourselves sanitation engineers. 

I'm not on reddit often, but if anyone wants some help, feel free to DM me. I'll hop on a call or help with a resume, etc.
