Frustrated with the Indian developers. Have you faced something similar?","I hired a software engineer to build an app in 2020.  At that time for the budget, it was ok because it was the MVP. I tested it out in the market and it was successful in the sample population of people I tested it on. 4 years apart, the app isn't doing well because of so many bugs. I involved a few software engineers to help but they all messed up the code. I am very frustrated and disappointed. These software engineers are from India, Pakistan and they are unprofessional, money sucking leeches, liars and are horrible. I don't know if it's the country or what. Even the initial software engineer I hired is the same. He is from India and when I asked him to fix the bugs, he quotes a very high price because he knows I don't have leverage. I am tired of being played out . I don't want to give up because the app is wonderful in the market and I just want to get this ground up. Any recommendations?","business",3,3,0,0.58,0,0,0,30

I've already had a bachelor degree in Business Administration, but it was only Very Good, not Excellent. In purely theoretical subjects like Marketing and Human Resource Management, I didn't get high scores. I'm just good at quantitative analysis subjects. I found out that now many schools are opening a Business Analyst major, which is quite similar to Business Administration but the difference is that it focuses more on quantitative analysis subjects. If any of you have studied Business Analyst, can you give me a review? Should I choose to study for a master's degree in Business Analyst?","business",1,1,0,0.6,0,0,0,0

The licenses are for various companies and have been active for years, but you can find zero information about any of these companies other than the business license. 

I just kind of stumbled across this information regarding the company I work for and I don't know if this is weird or nothing at all.  ","business",2,2,0,1,0,0,1,1

I believe it would make it less boring to the readers and learn in a more interesting way.  
  
Would founders and entrepreneurs be interested in reading this kind of stuff?
