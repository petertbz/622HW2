* COVID affecting supply chains.
* War in Ukraine affecting supply chains (gas and wheat).

* $2 Billion in tax cuts (Trump).


So, how can the inflation be Biden's fault? Your account says ""1991"" so I assume you're 32/33. You really need to have a more mature view of politics if you feel so strongly.

Also, we QE because rates were at 0%. Rates are no longer at 0% so QE will likely reduce and will not be the primary monetary policy lever in the next recession.

On top of that they have drained 2 trillion from the reverse repo balance over the last year which has all ended up in the economy one way or another.

&gt;But there are six stragglers: banks that still, after a decade, have neither gone under nor paid the money back. The largest of those is OneUnited Bank, which received $12 million way back in 2008

So 6 institutions haven't paid back the government for 2008. The largest borrowed $12 million. $12m is literally chump change compared to largest institutions like AIG or GM. So the truth here is somewhere in the middle. We haven't paid back 100% of the QE (you're correct) we've only paid back 99%.

Also, QE is structured as a loan so how can you say no one thinks it will get paid back? Unless the companies default then they'll pay it back. Can you provide some sources to back up the idea that the QE money is free and never gets paid back? I'm really not sure I see where you're getting that argument from and I'd love to understand a little bit better.","1_4_2_1_1_1_1"

&gt; What Is Quantitative Easing (QE)?

&gt;When a central bank decides to use QE, it makes large-scale purchases of financial assets, like government and corporate bonds and even stocks. This relatively simple decision triggers powerful outcomes: The amount of money circulating in an economy increases, which helps lower longer-term interest rates. This lowers the cost of borrowing, which spurs economic growth.

The fed unleashed 9t of QE since 2010.

You can google QE and theres plenty of articles detailing the feds actions regarding its balance sheet etc.

In my opinion, we are spending less than 1% of the total national budget to cripple our greatest enemy. Russia/USSR was our primary geopolitical rival. They are explicitly anti America. They interfere with elections, they foment unrest abroad, they are one of the 3 explicitly Anti West countries (with China and Iran). Turning our backs and ignoring Russia while they commit the biggest mistake and largest aggression in a generation is not a good strategy. The best strategy IMO is to spend a measly 1% of our budget to destroy them.

Housing affordability is a combination of prices and rates. Rates were near 20% in the 80s, but people were still able to afford homes because prices weren't out of control. You could save interest-bearing money for a downpayment and still afford a home.

Americans need a net income increase of at least $12,000 per year just to maintain the same standard of living they had in January 2021.

[The typical American household must spend an additional $11,434 annually just to maintain the same standard of living they enjoyed in January of 2021, right before inflation soared to 40-year highs, according to a recent analysis of government data.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-more-spend-maintain-100020606.html)

All the basic essentials needed to survive cost significantly more than they did 3 or 4 years ago - food, shelter, utilities, transportation, fuel, etc.

Inflation is a hidden tax that hurts people who have the least the most.

The dollar has been devalued and lost purchasing power.

Combine inflation with high interest rates, and homeownership or even buying a car has become out of reach for millions of hardworking people.

But the rich keep getting richer - people who already own their properties and who have fat bank accounts are benefiting from inflation and high interest rates - they are seeing their assets increase in value and their savings grow.

The wealth gap keeps getting wider.

Pretty much every study I've seen shows millennials in the worst situation over the past 25 years, but then also makes a special curiously hyper-specific footnote that it's much worse than that for those born between 81 and 83.

It's like the stars for them aligned perfectly, but the stars were: 

* Columbine and 9/11 when they are in emotionally vulnerable life stages that define mental health forever. Old enough to understand, but too young to cope with it.
* Entering college when costs are soaring but loan interest rates and availability of low income aid are terrible pre-Obama. 
* Probably loses a sibling or friend to the war in Afghanistan while being pushed to the edge by character building severe college workload.
* Unpaid internship trend kicks in just as they graduate college
* 2008 financial crisis when they were supposed to exit their ""pay your dues"" period and start making decent money.
* Startup company gig work exploitation when they should have started getting raises or converting to larger salaries with benefits.
* COVID shutdown when they would have started to make good money on well established careers.
* Post-COVID Greedflation, particularly on the bare necessities, which for many is the vast majority of their budget. 

That's without even going into the many non-event-based overall wealth transfer to the top issues that have brutally held down all pre-retirement-age generations.

And we couldn't even agree on shaving $10K off the balance of student loans they will never have enough money to repay anyway.

Mark my words, when older millennials hit retirement age in 20 years, or lose their jobs in 10 years to the AI and automation revolution, space aliens with their own damn problems are gonna read about humanity like America reads about Yemen.","4"

And yeah, while America had poignantly dark milestones, most of these things affected the global economy. One thing I will say though, is that American salaries are misleading.

Which is partly why it's so strange that we consider you millennial at all. For many, many years they didn't have a settled upon name so people didn't call them anything, or just said ""Gen Y"". Then as adults they heard about millennials, and knew what that was, but were retroactively informed that they too were millennials, not Gen Y, despite fitting almost none of the millennial characteristics written about.

I've also heard it referred to as the ""Wait Generation"" because they waited to get jobs, to mature into adulthood, to go to college in many cases, to move out of the house, to buy their first cars, to start careers, to get married, to take promotions, and to have kids.

If someone dies with debt that debt is erased. It's not paid back by the government.

The largest creditors in the US? I'm going to just Google this because it's something we can easily prove. The largest creditors of US debt is China and Japan. Domestically the largest creditors are large banks, pensions, etc. I don't really follow how that is relevant though, can you walk me through why that's related to the original argument? Seems kind of... Like you're just grasping at straws and throwing arguments to see what sticks. 

&gt;And finally, there is not a world where struggling credit card companies will not be bailed out through the Federal Reserve printing money to keep them afloat

It depends on how it goes down. If enough large financial institutions are going to collapse and it poses a systemic risk to the entire economy then they get bailed out. They get a loan and that loan gets paid back. If a single bank or CC company fails it's unlikely they can bailed out (unless they post a systemic risk) and I'm not sure e.g. Visa poses a systemic risk.","5_4_1_1_1"

1. The tax was already paid, why would the inheritor have to pay the exact same tax again?

2. If they sell the stock at a gain in comparison to the new adjusted basis. Yes, they have to pay gains on the stock.

Probably the biggest impact would be from eliminating the separate tax rates on capital gains vs income. If they were taxed at the same rate, it would get rid of an entire industry of tax lawyers and advisors funding ways to transform income into cap gains. Meet somewhere in the middle, maybe 30% would be the top rate. People who make most or all of their money from wages would get a tax cut, and private equity/hedge fund carried interest would be taxed a bit higher than currently.

The other thing is eliminating the basis step-up at death. Generational wealth is largely un-taxed currently since the basis resets to the current market value at the time of death. There could be decades of unrealized gains that become untaxable after death. There could be a carve out with a reasonable cap so that middle class families can pass a house or modest inheritance to heirs with the stepped up basis, but massive real estate empires and billionaire's assets would retain the initial cost basis.","35"

The last flip flop on TikTok after talking with the billionaire owner, despite leading the charge against TikTok and Chinese influence 4 years ago, was the last in a long line.

I understand wanting to follow a strong man leader. I do not understand why people trust him to do anything except look out for Donald Trump.","1"

I don't think Trump supporters care if Trump's interests align with the Nation. Rather they care most about Trump's interests aligning against people they dislike. It is the ole saying 'enemy of my enemy is my friend'. 

American life has actually been real good over the last 40yrs. Few voters (only about 60% of eligible people vote) have experienced true hardship in their lives. Folks don't think who they elect matters on a massive scale and take for granted everything in society will mostly be the same. As such they vote to thumb their noses at others. 

Trump supporters like the idea that Trump causes mental hardship to liberals. Pronouns, plastic bags, and solar panels are things Trump supporters enjoy antagonizing others about. It's fun. Likewise the plight of single moms, over policed demographics, and exploited immigrant workers are matters they suspect are all just made up. Trump supporters think it's all a lie and are angry about it. Even if something simple could be done to help that would cost nothing they still wouldn't do it. 

The point of Trump isn't to improve anything national. Trump is a physical manifestation of annoyance and division.","1_2"

Fascism is a phenomenon of captialism  


Unregulated captialism will ALWAYS devolve into fascism. 


The 2 party system is just the vehicle for the rise of American captialsim, and therefore American fascism.


I do actually believe that the destruction of the 2 party system would help regulate the captialst system, and therefore could be used to stave off American fascism....


But it's a little too late for that now. 


When you compare the rise of Trump to the rise of Hitler, all of the similarities are terrifying....and those similarities have only gotten worse over the last 4 years.


And despite having different electoral systems, the factions both within and outside of those systems have aligned identically. 


The ""liberal"" party has veered right in response to the rise of the far right, and now functions as a traditionally conservative party, desperately trying to maintain the status quo.


The conservative party has begin purging non-party loyalists, as the fascists seize complete control of the establishment structure 


Subsequently, the working classes no longer see a difference between the two parties, and are choosing the more radical party out of a need for radical change


Lefitsts, seeing these blunders, is turning on the ""liberal"" party, finding strange bedfellows with the far right, both politically and ideologically  


Like, yeah we have fewer ""parties,"" but the ideological factions are practically identical.


...it's not all doom and gloom, there are a few absolute differences  


Trump and his factions aren't nearly as intelligent or ideological as the Hitler/Nazis.


They are all just in it for themselves, they don't really have greater ideals like ""German nationalism.""


The Nazis were true believers, and the American far right absolutely isn't (even though their voters are).


Also, Trump is much older than Hitler...in fact, his whole crew is much older than the Nazis were. Trump, Bannon, Roger Stone. Etc. Are all easily 10-20 years older than their Nazi counterparts. 


And, of course, the biggest difference: the economy. 


For how bad the American economy is right now, it's booming compared to the Great Depression. 


I don't know if people are necessarily desperate enough to support such radicalized, far-right figures. ","1_5_1_3"

Democrats would probably like to attribute a large portion of the [GDP] growth gap to better fiscal (and perhaps monetary) policies, but the data do not support such a claim. If anything, and we would not make much of such small differences, both fiscal and monetary policy actions seem to be a bit more pro-growth when a Republican is president.

The US economy has performed better when the president of the United States is a Democrat rather than a Republican, almost regardless of how one measures performance. For many measures, including real GDP growth (our focus), the performance gap is large and significant. This paper asks why. The answer is not found in technical time series matters nor in systematically more expansionary monetary or fiscal policy under Democrats. Rather, it appears that the Democratic edge stems mainly from more benign oil shocks, superior total factor productivity (TFP) performance, a more favorable international environment, and perhaps more optimistic consumer expectations about the near-term future","27_2_1_1_1_1"

 While inflation usually occurs in a growing economy, stagflation's unique combination forces policymakers into a dilemma: raising interest rates to combat inflation can further suppress economic growth and increase unemployment, while lowering rates to boost the economy can exacerbate inflation. This complex scenario creates a **no-win situation** for central banks, complicating efforts to stabilize the economy and adversely affecting both consumer confidence and business investment.

I do not want to be in Fed's shoes right now.","1"

Signs that the U.S. economy is flipping from goldilocks to stagflation have multiplied recently, according to Michael Hartnett, a BofA Global equity strategist. The shift could have serious ramifications for the stock market that many investors arent yet taking seriously.

Stagflation refers to simultaneously elevated inflation and weak economic growth, which bedeviled the U.S. economy for most of the 1970s and into the early 1980s. Goldilocks refers to when an economy is growing at a moderate pace thats not hot enough to stoke inflation.

Earlier this week, investors digested two hotter-than-expected inflation reports. Consumer prices rose at a rate of 3.2% over the past 12 months, and the rate could accelerate to 3.6% by June, Hartnett said.

Traders are currently pricing in more than 50% probability that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in June, for the first time since it began raising them in March 2022, according to the CME Groups FedWatch Tool.

Signs of a revival in inflation arent confined to the U.S., Hartnett said. Accelerating price pressures around the world have already inspired some emerging-markets central banks to pause plans to cut interest rates.","2"

If an AI suddenly causes significant damages, rules will be changed prior to full collapse because protecting personal wealth is the great societal unifier. 

Most means of collapse are avoidable. The governments would eventually agree to call it a mulligan, sort things out, and society would survive because were all just folks in the end.




Long answer: The current AI is based on advanced search algorithms and is poorly regulated market. Either there will be a problem allowed by lack of regulation that gets people killed or causes a rapid/unpredicted change in the market. After the SNAFU, either a governing body will regulate AI or the first group to map the marketplace to the point where it can monitor/manipulate all other AI will take control.

Next Gen AI will resolve the fidelity problem (Skynet scenarios) by having dedicated teams of experts moderating the results to prevent catastrophic liabilities. Right now, if any of the AI firms move too quickly and they fuck up along the way, thats their ass, so the likelihood of an unintentional Skynet happening in the next 3 years low.

After ~3 years, we may reach the Sauron problem, in which a 2nd Gen Econ AI tries to corner some market by being trained to manipulate the first generation AI. However, creating such a disastrous AI is problematic for all players, so legislation will probably be passed to prevent it.

If a foreign power tries to ratfuck other countries using a Sauron AI, that would be bad. But if it crashes the stock market or turns off electric grids, etc, the economy would still be correctable, though a war economy isnt fun.","3"

"690","https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1bg6uib/polish_clothing_giant_lpp_sees_share_price/","BubsyFanboy","2024-03-16",1710601922,1,1,0,0,"&gt;Polands biggest clothing company LPP, owner of brands such as Reserved, Cropp and Mohito, has seen its shares nosedive on Friday after a US investment research firm published a report alleging LPP has secretly maintained its operations in Russia despite pledging to leave.

&gt;The company has lost about 11 billion zloty (¬2.5 billion) in market capitalisation and ended the day with an almost 36% drop in share prices.

&gt;LPP denounced the accusations, saying the report prepared by Hindenburg Research was part of an organised disinformation attack designed to drive down its share price.


&gt;The report, published on Friday morning and titled Operating Behind Enemy Lines, presented evidence purporting to show that LPP carried out a sham sale of its business in Russia and, in fact, continues to profit from the countrys market despite EU sanctions and public disapproval.

&gt;LPP, which has 2,206 stores with a total of over 1.9 million square meters of retail space across 27 countries, was valued at 33.1 billion zloty (¬7.7 billion) before todays falls. In the fiscal year ending in January 2023, it recorded revenue of 15.9 billion zloty (¬3.7 billion).

&gt;Hindenburg Research noted that, despite LPP saying it lost about 20% of revenue from divesting its Russian operations in June 2022, it still saw noted that total revenue remarkably grow 13% overall.

&gt;The research company also pointed out that LPPs reported rise in revenue across markets excluding Russia was  40.5% year-on-year, a level virtually unheard of in the retail apparel industry.

&gt;We believe LPP was able to post these remarkable results because its divestment of its Russia business has been a complete sham, wrote Hindenburg Research, which specialises in researching cases of alleged corporate fraud and malfeasance.


&gt;Russia was LPPs biggest international market before the invasion of Ukraine. But, like many international firms, soon after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Polish firm announced that it would divest its Russian business.

&gt;LPP said it sold its Russian assets, called RE Trading, to a Chinese consortium in a $382 million deal (¬350 million).

&gt;We found that the buyer was a Dubai-based shell called Far East Services with no disclosure of its owners or directors, wrote Hindenburg Research, which attached to its report a document from the Russian tax authority, showing that the sale of 95% of LPPs Russian subsidiary was finalised on 30 June 2022.

&gt;Far East Services was incorporated just one day before LPP announced it had reached an agreement to sell its Russian subsidiary, noted the research company, adding that Far East Services has no externally verifiable presence, track record in the fashion industry, or apparent associations with China.","1"
"691","https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1bg6uib/polish_clothing_giant_lpp_sees_share_price/","BubsyFanboy","2024-03-16",1710605018,1,1,0,0,"&gt;Hindenburg Research also claims to have confirmed the false nature of the divestment with former senior LPP employees and managers, who reportedly claim that LPPs Russian operations are still directly controlled by LPP HQ and board.

&gt;A former manager described LPP CEO and founder Marek Piechockis approach: He didnt give a f*ck about some war between Russia and Ukraine. This [war] is just temporary, they quoted an anonymous former employee as saying.

&gt;In December 2023, Hindenburg Research also dispatched secret shoppers to Far East Services flagship stores in Moscow and St Petersburg.

&gt;They found that almost all garments were identical designs and colours to fall/winter collections in LPP´s online catalogues in Poland, indicating that LPPs products are still somehow making their way into Russia at least 18 months after the claimed divestiture.


&gt;The research company alleged that LPP waas managing to supply the Russian market using Kazakhstan as a backdoor.

&gt;Import-export records show that LPP shipped ~$755 million of merchandise to its Kazakh subsidiary in 2023, despite Kazakhstan only accounting for 1% of LPPs brick-and-mortar stores, they said.

&gt;They Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan have seen a rise in Polish imports since the invasion of Ukraine, with many firms believed to be using them as a way to indirectly ship products to Russia, bypassing sanctions.

&gt;Hindenberg Research also accused LPP of accounting manipulation to cover its tracks. It noted that over two thirds of the firms revenue growth in 2022/23 was reported as being in an unexplained Other segment of its annual report, much higher than in previous years.


&gt;LPP has strongly denied the allegation in several statements published throughout Friday. It called the contents of the report either false or manipulated, saying it is part of an organised disinformation attack, which has been in preparation for the last five months and is designed to drive down the LPP Groups share price.

&gt;It announced that it has notified prosecutors in Poland about a possible offence to the detriment of LPP SA and its shareholders, listed investors, threatening the security of the financial market.

&gt;Hindenburg Research did disclose that, following its investigation, the company has taken a short position in shares of LPP S.A., meaning it is betting on its further falls.","1_1"
