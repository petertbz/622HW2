I owned a company starting in October 2023. In December 2023, my friend and I joined forces but now circumstances have changed and she is leaving. (Under good circumstances, not that it matters but there is no anger or animosity whatsoever) 

We are both concerned about how it looks going forward. I will legally have her taken off of the business, but how do taxes work for the portion of the year that we were in a partnership? We have the money set aside for it, but Im continuing the business and would like to continue under the same name. 

I guess the bottom line of my question is this: How do we know how much she owes as a partner for 4 months and how much will I know that I owe as an individual for the rest of the year? 

Thank you! 

(PS - We do plan on speaking with a tax professional soon! I just figured I would ask here as well so I have a general idea) ","business",2,2,0,1,0,0,0,1

I need to start a company because I'm about to release commercial software and I'm struggling to decide on the most future-proofed country to start my business. Ireland and the UK seem to have similar pros from a tax/economy perspective etc, but since I plan on living in Europe later on would it be better to have an EU company as that may be more flexible since Brexit?

If anyone has any insight into emigrating while owning a company in the UK/EU, or just the company ownership, I'd greatly appreciate it, thank you for your time.","business",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,4

If you are beginning, what data is worth saving and what is not? I assume you can use an Excel.

For example, date of sale, amount, tax, etc. Come to mind but what did you end up doing? 

In addition, what KPIs should you be watching out for?

I know a bit of the standard company balance sheets at Annual Reports but they seem to broad for a tiny just-starting company.

I understand my business model but dont know the ins and outs of actually registering myself/my business, nor how to invoice or do taxes.

The model is basically: I live in Norway and recruit Norwegian students and send them to NZ schools and take a 15% commission on what the schools fees are + admin fees that I decide on. Id travel between Norway and NZ a couple times a year recruiting and then following them back to NZ.

1. How do I start up this business to be able to invoice and do taxes? Should I choose self-employed or a company?

2. In Norway or NZ?
I can choose how Im paid, for example whether I invoice the parents of the Norwegian students directly, or invoice the NZ schools, hence the confusion around whether I set up the business in NZ or Norway for tax reasons and whatever else etc.
