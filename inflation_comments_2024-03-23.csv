 Also chip production is all time high NOW, after 3 years of ramp-up...nevermind most chips are low grade chips... 70% of high end chips come from TSMC in taiwan... A single supplier in one country.

Biden literally change mpg standards this week, so more govt redtape. Govt been increasing requirements for decades.

You know it took 2 decades just for the US government to accept square vs round headlights, then 1 decade to accept plastic vs glass headlights, then 1 decades to accept combined high/low composite headlights, 1 decade for HID headlights, 1 decade for led array headlights... europe allow most same stuff in 1/4 the time...thats a lot of lobbying &amp; bribbing which cost money. Headlights are just 1 part of a car!

Notice there hasn't been simple steel bumpers on cars, govt mandate that you car hit a person at speeds less than 40mph and they have LESS inury (not none).. that means expensive molded plastic bumpers, with foam.

Again previous poster pointed out how much more crap is in cars and they are right, I bought my last vehicle as new acura which was better than a fully loaded honda accord at the time. If I want another similar model its now 1.7x cost, why:

Because it has 4 more airbags;&amp;#10;
Has to meet newer small overlap test;&amp;#10;
Govt req backup sensors and camera;&amp;#10;
The car has more electronics and software for customer demanded infotainment and bluetooth, and wifi;1&amp;#10;
Govt req better fuel mileage and less smog... same reason pickup trucks keep getting bigger every year to sidestep govt mpg rules (thanks obama);&amp;#10;
Govt removed mtbe from gas, which mean i need to use synthetic oil and lower weight oil, to keep engines cleaner and lubricated with less friction to maintain same mpg;&amp;#10;
The cars needed beefed up starters for start-stop (due to mpg req);&amp;#10;
Cars now have cooled seats, not just heated seats;&amp;#10;
Extra usb charging ports and rear usb and aux ports;&amp;#10; Separate heating/cooling zones for rear (my car had 2, new car has 4);&amp;#10;
Increased use of CRP to reduce weight vs steel or aluminum (again mpg);&amp;#10;
Customer demanded blindspot monitoring + the sensors and vehicle lane assist and self parking...(my existing vechicle it was only an add-on/cost upgrade for vehicle lane assist);&amp;#10;

Again these are additional changes between two 4door sedans, base models, same manufacturer.
