What Do You Think?","Hello everyone. I (21 M) am gearing up to launch my own construction company. Initially focusing on residential construction, especially spec homes, I aim to to eventually branch into commercial projects.   


Currently, I reside in SWFL, where the cost of living and doing business is quite high. Renting an office space in my area demands a hefty $4,500 monthly commitment, often with long-term leases of 5-10 years.   


However, an interesting alternative from my parents has come up, and I'd really value your perspectives, particularly imagining yourselves as potential clients.   


Here's the idea: My famil'es home, where I currently live, sits on a half-acre lot. A substantial part of this land, specifically on the right side of the house, is not used. We do have a pool and an outside bar and things like that, but they lean more into the middle and left side of the property. This space, is currently used for storage, it's well maintained and has really nice landscaping.  


My mom had previously considered constructing a studio on this spot. Although those plans changed, the possibility has re-emerged with building a professional 25x20 office space. My dad said to make it 30x20 but I dont really see a huge difference. The concept includes a small bathroom, a meeting area, and 2 office spaces. My mom plans to enhance the landscaping, extending the driveway/path to the the entrance, and creating a dedicated entrance that offers privacy and separation from the main house.  


She envisions a modern design with a full glass front, adding a contemporary and welcoming touch to the office. I know it sounds like she is just taking control of it all, but we have similar visions and I love the picture idea that shes been showing me. I just have no idea on how to post it to this post.   


The location isnt remote, were just a couple minutes from local plazas and resturants, and theres ample driveway space for client parking.   


Additionally, I'd like to address a future aspect of this setup. I share a strong bond with my parents, who are fully supportive of this idea. However, a question did arise regarding the scenario when I eventually move out. My plan is straightforward; the office will remain functioning independently. Living elsewhere wont affect the professional aspect of the office space. It will simply transition into a place I commute to for work. Also, the proposed office area will be physically separated from the main house by a fence. This delineation makes sure that it doesnt impact the day to day life in the main house, even when I choose to live elsewhere.   


My question to you is: How would you, as a client seeking custom home construction or remodeling or whatever it is, perceive this office setup? Does it come off as unprofessional or innovative? Im particularly interested in first impressions and any concerns you might have.  


Thank you for your time reading this and your thoughts. If you have any question regarding anything more specific or asking for more detail I will make sure to respond as soon as I can.

Im wanting to make a business, &amp; I have a lot to learn, so I do have a lot of questions. 

Does anyone have any helpful insight on how I might be able to find somewhere to outsource the manufacturing of the product I want to sell.  I want to do the designing but send it off to someone to make this into a product. Im looking for a Sock manufacturer specifically.

My question is what product could I buy, or way could I invest that money, that would allow me to gain the most back. 

It could be anything. 3d printer, heat sensing drone,  ice cream van. What reckons you?

","I own a business and I hate my unemployment insurance in my state. They are difficult to deal with. I recently had an issue with my payroll where the account # was off and $8k didn't get paid. While we tried to figure out why, they fined me an additional $43,000. How $8k turns into $51k over an account # error seems like straight up robbery to me. Because of this I want to 1099 the couple guys I have. 

I normally pay around $20-$30 an hour, paid holidays, 2 weeks vacation, additional education and half the medical. Some exceptions to this but basic idea. 

There are also better tax benefits for independent contractors that I hope they take advantage of. 

What sounds like a fair pay increase to cover them being 1099?

Im thinking:

$2.5 unemployment compensation. 

$1 holiday &amp; vacation. 

$10.5 medical

$1 misc

Total $15 additional an hr. 

So a $20 employee will be paid $35 and hr. I'd still pay for any additional schooling. 

Does the additional $15 an hr sound fair, what am I missing and what do you think correct compensation should be. 

Ps: I don't see any tax benefits or downside for me if I do this. Do you see any downside on my end? ","business",1,1,0,0.54,0,0,0,11

As B&amp;C are both foreigners, and A is local, A is supposed to take care of local operations and liaise with local clients while B&amp;C handle the directions of the business as they are the experts in the area. Fundings are mainly from investors who are found by A and A is also the person who initiated the whole idea. It turns out that B &amp; C are not able to work with each other in the company, so A can only keep one. 

Pros of B
- has provided a plan which would work long term
- seems to have more network and connections than C 
- willing to work without pay as a founder


Cons of B
- has a high ego 
- very very short tempered 
- does not listen to any other options other than own
- always yells when not agreed with
- not very open to suggestions
- selfs assumes a lot of things and refusing to listen to explanations
- never feels that he is at fault and blames others
- must always be in full control
- always exits the meeting when his ends are not met despite meetings have not ended
- has threatened to leave on multiple of occasions if everyone else does not comply with his demands.

Pros of C
- has provided a plan which could work in accordance to current market conditions
- able to communicate with an open mind.
- patient and harmonious

Cons of C
- might not have as much resources or connections as B
- might not be as experienced as B
- willing to work both in legal work and grey area things
- C is a fresher member to the team
- Requires a higher cost to work with (higher salary, more expensive &amp;experienced teammates, etc)

Any advise would be much appreciated. 
TL:DR; deciding whether to choose between a person with a more experienced angry egotistical person or a calmer less experienced person to work with.

This retailer has gone through a leveraged buyout in the past and declared chapter 11 a few years ago. However, it doesnt seem like it is doing poorly sales wise as a whole (the company is private so its hard to get an accurate read). In fact, it seems like numbers have been going up for some time.

My question is has anyone seen this happen or implemented this approach at a retail location before? Is a move like this a sign that they have a sense they can increase their sales of high end products, or is this a move a struggling company does to make itself look better to a prospective buyer?

Sorry for the vague descriptions, Im just curious if anyone has tried this before and what the results were","business",0,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,0
