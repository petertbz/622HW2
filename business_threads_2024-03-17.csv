I deny this and allege that there are plenty of people who have the raw ""talent"" to do the jobs and employers are too hung up on background, work experience, work history and credentials.  In fact many Millennials and Genz with college degrees are underemployed/unemployed.  Smart employers realize that the guy working at the gas station may be a potential computer programmer or business analyst.   I know such person who ran a small business. Most employers, however, are ""in the box"" employers and bandwagoners. They're trend hoppers looking to hire the latest trendy candidate, rather than intellectuals who think for themselves.  They don't realize that the brainpower is there even though the credentials and trackrecord is not.   Basically employers try to steal employees from other employers in the same job function.

Any insight or numbers correction advise is highly appreciated. 

I want to get a sleeper truck 13 speed mack kw or Pete aerodynamic no long nose. I don't like freightliners they ride like garbage but I'm open if I get good deal since it's easier to find parts service on them in my area at least.

Conservative activists have been targeting executive compensation that rewards leaders for meeting DEI goals because they 
                       contend that such incentives might encourage illegal hiring behavior to meet company diversity targets. 
                        Its part of a broader backlash against corporate diversity programs after the US Supreme Court ruled that affirmative action in 
                        college enrollment is illegal.

Strive Asset Management, an anti-activism fund company co-founded by former Republican presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy, sent a letter to Southwest Airlines Co. in August warning it to end its executive compensation incentives for environmental and social goals. The group has also met privately with about a dozen large companies on the issue, according to Justin Danhof, Strives head of corporate governance, declining to name the companies.

Companies use compensation plans to highlight issues they believe are important to investors, employees, customers, and the general public, Tharp said. He added that opposition to the incentives, such as a letter last year from 13 state attorneys general questioning the legality of certain companies DEI plans, will definitely spark caution going forward.

Starbuckss equality, social and governance goals will be part of a longer-term incentive program that makes up about 25% of bonuses that no longer mentions DEI, referring instead to talent. 

            The portion of the bonus paid for hitting financial targets rose to 75%, from 70%.

Sorry if you've seen this post a bunch of times, it's just that this is really urgent.  
I'm 17 years old. I live in the UAE. I've started working on an online business, however I still haven't launched it, primarily because of a payment issue.  
I want to carry this business out discretely without my parents knowing, because if they find out, they'll tell me to stop working on it and focus on my studies. As for my payment issue, all I have is a PayPal account with no card linked to it. Because I'm too young to have one, obviously. Even if I was 18, my parents would not give me one straight away.  
The downsides to this is that not many people around the world rely on PayPal only, so even if they like my product, they just won't bother to go through the hassle of making an account :(  
Can someone please tell me if there's some way to have a digital wallet without having to put investments in to it, or could someone lend me a credit card with no money in it (trying to avoid this btw)?  
I genuinely have so much hope in my business, if someone could help me, I'd be forever grateful.  
Thank you so much,","business",6,6,0,0.8,0,0,0,20

I am a veterinarian, my fathers a vet too and runs a business in animal healthcare. He is a first gen entrepreneur and has done really well for himself. After I finished my post graduation I decided to join him. But 1.5 years down the line I have realised that I dont enjoy working with him or working on the projects that he likes. My strengths are different and are not put to use here. We have a lot of opinion differences and since we stay together and work together I think the resentment from work reflects at home and vice versa.

Now I told him I am applying for jobs in other companies, he is not very happy about it but I have managed to get him on board. 
Coming to the main question- Do you guys think me applying for other jobs in the same space as my own (my fathers) company creates a conflict of interest during the hiring process? If yes, what should I do? If no, what is a good enough non controversial convincing reason for leaving a job in a my fathers company?

","So my partner and our roommate/best friend both work for a moving company, and have for the last year and a half. They always have some wild stories from the day, between client interactions and stuff, and usually explain how things work as it relates to whatever happened in said story. Because of this I feel like I have a general idea of how things operate in that line of work. 
Now, I say all of this because I'm currently job hunting, and there's a different moving company 5 mins from where they work (which is excellent because we share a vehicle) that's hiring for an office assistant. From what I've learned from them, and my own skills, I feel like I'm qualified for the job; so I applied. I didn't consider until after the application was submitted that if I were offered the position, my relationships with the 2 of them could be a conflict of interest...

Is that correct? Would that be something that would prohibit me from getting the job? It isn't something I want to be deceptive about at all, especially considering because we share a vehicle there are often times where if they are off work before me, they'll come get the car from me at my job. So if I got the job my coworkers wohld eventually find out where they work. But, if it's going to rule me out as a candidate for the job, I won't even pursue it. ","business",1,1,0,0.67,0,0,0,5
