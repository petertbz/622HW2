Across all types of schools, the cost of college has increased more than 135%, or about 2.3 times, between 1963 and 2021. Compared to other school types, four-year public colleges saw the steepest price hikes from 2000-2021, jumping from roughly $14,000 a year to just under $22,000 annually.


Forgiveness would be unnecessary had the government continued to adequately support higher education. ","1"

Forgiveness was always a device to drive younger voters to the voting booth and get excited about a Biden/Harris ticket. They had nothing to lose and everything to gain by promising the golden goose, and just like how Dems chose to never legislate Abortion and remain satisfied with Roe for 50 years, the voterbase is either too blind or too complacent to hold their party accountable for grifting them for votes and getting little to nothing in return.","1_1_1_1_1_1"

Don't get me wrong, Higher Ed is a racket. I used to work in financial aid for colleges and that entire system is in desperate need of sweeping reform. My point is simply that the Biden campaign, in a very astute political calculation, used forgiveness to get the gullible and the desperate excited enough to go to the polls and vote for one of the most unappealing candidates in anyone's memory to beat Trump. There was no downside or risk for them to do it.

They would have tried to formally legislate it instead of trying to stand up a creative interpretation of law by executive order in front of a conservative court that everyone knew was going to be very conservative. Or maybe they could have tried something with stimulus payments, or somehow nationalized the debt, perhaps by purchasing it back. There were several avenues.

I don't know about counting on it failing, I think the nuance is that they had nothing to lose and everything to gain. In other words, the Biden campaign was playing ""heads I win, tails you lose."" Think about it. If it works, you fulfilled a promise. If it doesn't, you can say it would have worked if not for the Republicans, and everyone should vote Blue if they want to try again.

I agree that it's cynical but I don't think it's wrong. We're talking about an election for President of the United States. Not sure there are any higher stakes than that out there.","1_1_1_1_1_1_1_2_1_1"

University's ""lack of incentive"" to lower prices has nothing to do with bailout of grads.  They already got paid.

The universities know the govt will guarantee loans that should really never be approved in the first place, so the cycle of ever increasing tuition costs will continue.

Student loan forgiveness for a select few is not a solution. It's a bandaid, and it's a political move. Biden's only doing it now because the election is approaching, and he is losing popularity among young voters (I'm sure many who voted for him because they thought he'd forgive all student loan debt).","1_2_1_2"

That is part of the problem, yes, but it's not a 1:1 problem.  What is worth the tradeoff, however, is that the loans make college accessible to families that could otherwise not afford it.  Education also has inherent worth.  We need a more educated population especially to compete in the international economy.  This is a case of the cure for the disease not being to kill the patient.

Your bit about Biden is partisan rhetoric that is often repeated.  First of all, the loan forgiveness here is a policy that's been in place for over a decade now. The forgiveness comes if you work in the public sector for 10+ years of making regular payments on your loan. So it's not a new policy, it's that people are finally hitting the 10 year mark. Public sector workers take the lower paying job counting this as a benefit.

Second, it is a legitimate crisis.  Many young people can't afford to have children (especially without government aid that is less than sufficient on top of everything) or get a house to grow their net worth, etc.  We're facing a birth rate problem.  It's making the economy inaccessible to them.  The loans are predatory in their terms and conditions and designed to be a debt trap that you can't get out of from bankruptcy unlike other debt.","1_2_1_2_1"

***No such right exists.***

We need to set a cap on wealth accumulation. Wealth inequality feeds upon itself and is destructive of democracies and free societies, because no matter how big you ""grow the pie"", the superwealthy will always want more of it, and through the power their wealth gives them, they will *take* it. Any economist who claims that wealth distribution is not zero-sum is a liar. Anyone who believes that lie is a deluded fool.

&gt;In 2022, Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla and SpaceX, was ranked first in the billionaires list published by the US business magazine Forbes. Suppose you worked 50 hours a week between the ages of 20 and 65  week in week out, year in year out  how much would your hourly wage need to be so that by the end you had amassed Musks wealth? The answer is: $1,871,794 per hour. Almost two million dollars per hour. Every working hour for 45 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elon Musk might be seen as exceptional, but there were 2,668 other billionaires on that Forbes list. Together they held $12,700,000,000,000. Do you, like me, see all those zeros dancing before your eyes? Thats because we dont know how to take in that number. On average the value of their assets is $4.75bn. If we ask the same question again  whats the average lifetime hourly wage?  we get $40,598 per hour, the equivalent to what many Americans hope to earn in a year.

The part of your video that discusses what people pay in social security tax is misleading garbage.  The amount you pay in social security is capped because guess what?  The amount you get paid when you retire is also capped.  In fact, the amount you can get paid is capped so low, that people in the top 10% end up paying WAY more into social security than they can ever hope to get out from it.  More so, if they had just been allowed to keep their own money and invest it themselves for their own retirement, they would retire with MILLIONS more than they will ever be paid by social security.  So far from the cap being a windfall for rich people, social security is a massive drain on them.  In fact, it ends up that most top 10% earners could retire YEARS earlier if they weren't burdened with the government stealing their retirement money and giving it less successful people through the scam of social security.

EDIT:  I can't get over how stupid this social security issue is, so I have to continue:

Someone making $160,200 per year pays $9,945 per year into social security. Assuming they work 40 years, that means they pay $397,800 into social security.  They are capped at being paid $39,946 per year from social security after retirement at age 67.  Life expectancy is 77 years, so thats an average of 10 years, or $399,460.  So theyve made a whopping $1,660 on their investment.  
Meanwhile, if they had been allowed to opt out of social security, and just invested that $9,945 in the S&amp;P 500 every year, it would have grown to $5,241,000 in that 40 years.  Whats that you say?  They dont need $5,000,000 to retire?  Well, thats not your call to make.  But heres the really horrific truth:  Lets say youre right.  What if they only want a million dollars to retire?  Well, they WOULD HAVE had that in only 24 years, if they would have been allowed to opt out of social security.  So, because they were FORCED to pay into social security, they had to work for an additional 16 years, and STILL not retire with millions!  Social security ruined their lives!  
Meanwhile, someone who makes only $29,766 per year pays $2,277 annually into social security.  Over 40 years of employment, that comes to $91,084 paid in.  They can expect to collect $14,824 per year after retirement, which would be $140,824 over the ten years of their remaining life expectancy.  So they profit nearly $50,000 from social security.  You might think, See?  It benefits the poor!  No, it doesnt.  Because if they had just been allowed to keep their own damn money and invest it in the S&amp;P 500, they would have retired with $1,200,000 million!    
Social security benefits no one.  Its time has past.  We should just teach sound investment strategies and micro economics as mandatory classes in high school, and let the chips fall where they may.","8_3_1"

Here, I'll give you an example in concrete numbers.  You probably think that social security is a good thing.  I'm going to show you how wrong you are:

Someone making $160,200 per year pays $9,945 per year into social security. Assuming they work 40 years, that means they pay $397,800 into social security.  They are capped at being paid $39,946 per year from social security after retirement at age 67.  Life expectancy is 77 years, so thats an average of being paid for 10 years, or $399,460.

What if they only want a million dollars to retire?  Well, they WOULD HAVE had that in only 24 years, if they would have been allowed to opt out of social security and invest that money in the market.  So, because they were FORCED to pay into social security, they had to work for an additional 16 years, and STILL not retire with millions!  Social security ruined their lives, and basically turned them into slaves for 16 years.  
I can hear you saying, ""But social security benefits the POOR!""  Nope.   
 Someone who makes only $29,766 per year pays $2,277 annually into social security.  Over 40 years of employment, that comes to $91,084 paid in.  They can expect to collect $14,824 per year after retirement, which would be $140,824 over the ten years of their remaining life expectancy.  So they profit nearly $50,000 from social security.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predistribution

The problem with the ""tax and redistribute"" solution to inequality/oppression is that the people who have grotesque amounts of wealth and power are able to not only prevent redistribution, but also to bludgeon everyone else into giving up everything else also.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uzc-5BQKz4

Another issue is, systemic corruption in our political system means that voters have essentially zero influence on public policy when their preferences conflict with those of our ruling oligarchs/kleptocrats.

We need to solve our systemic corruption problem before ""government"" will even be capable of taking on our ruling oligarchs/kleptocrats, who are obviously extremely well resourced.

Economists as a profession have been basically hired by the grotesquely wealthy to give license and ideological cover to their plundering, so many obvious features of reality have been ignored by policymakers as the grotesquely wealthy continue their looting.

https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2024/03/Symposium-Rethinking-Economics-Angus-Deaton 

By the time you get to questions of taxation, all the major resourcing and policy decisions have already been made.  

So taxing the rich as a standalone solution without looking at ""predistribution"" is kind of like coming in at the 9th inning when you're already down by 1000 runs and expecting to turn things around.  The game is already over at that point, but people just haven't realized it yet.

Which is part of why shortening the work week (which we should have done when women entered the paid labor force in meaningful numbers, doubling the paid labor supply) is so important - people need to have time to develop fully, and to participate in their communities and political processes in order to challenge the power of our ruling oligarchs/kleptocrats.

I don't think people realize what goes into rezoning.  Before they rezone to allow a whole lot more people, they have to make sure the area can sustain that amount of people.  And if it can't, they have to make all the upgrades to make it able to sustain that amount of people.

If a city's current regulations say they allow x units per square mile, the utilities are set up to anticipate x units per square mile.  If you increase it, you're going to have to sure up all of those utilities.  Otherwise you get brown-outs, clogged sewers, overwhelmed schools, water shortages, and insane traffic.

It's not that easy.  Changing zoning laws is complicated process that involves fighting doing environmental impact research, utility preparedness studies, traffic studies, parking studies, service analysis, and a whole pile of other things.

Basically, if they want to take an area where the average lot size is 1/4 acre and say ""you can now put 3 homes on a lot instead of 1"" they'll have to make sure the electrical grid can actually supply that many homes, that the sewage system can handle that many homes, that the schools won't be overcrowded, that there's enough firemen for the increase in structures, that there's enough police for the increase in population, that the roads won't be constant gridlock, that there will be parking, and that there's enough water in the area to support that number of homes. Hell even things like internet, if ISPs ran lines into an area in anticipation of 1,000 homes and now there's suddenly 2,000 homes, they're going to have problems.

So it's more than just scratching out a minimum lot size and writing a new number, they have to make sure that new number is sustainable, first.  So, yes, it can be done, but it's definitely not ""easy.""","1_2_2"

Traditional IRA saves you taxes today, Roth IRA saves you taxes at retirement - lots of younger people chose this option.  Start depositing whatever you can each week, invest it into that brokerage's S&amp;P 500 index fund.  That's all you gotta do.  If you are 18, $22/week will make you a millionaire. If you wait until 30 to start, you need $65/week. Age 40 needs $167/week (this exceeds the limit for an IRA, so some would have to be in a non-tax qualified account).

Some people will argue here with me that ""$1M is nothing today"".  I argue $1M sure is better than actually having nothing.  Taking out 5% annually at retirement is $50k, average social security is $20k, so you'd have $70k a year income at retirement instead of $20k, that sounds pretty damn good to me.

Of course, even better, if you start making that $22/week contribution at 18 and keep increasing your contribution each year, you'll have several million at retirement.  Like if you do $22/week starting at 18, add another $65/week starting at age 30, add another $167/week at age 40, you'll be at $3M at retirement.  Marry someone doing the same as you, and you'll have a $6M net worth, withdrawing 5%, you'd have $300,000 annual income during retirement.

There are now more than 5.5 million Americans with liquid investible assets of more than $1 million, up 62% over the past decade and well above the global growth rate of 38%, according to the [2024 USA Wealth Report](https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/usa-wealth-report-2024) from Henley &amp; Partners and New World Wealth.

In the past five years, the population of millionaires in the U.S. has grown 35%, nearly twice as fast as Chinas. The U.S. is now home to 37% of the worlds millionaires, up from 35% in 2018.

The divergence grows even more at the top of the wealth ladder. The U.S. has 9,850 centi-millionaires (those worth $100 million or more) compared with Chinas 2,352. The U.S. has about 788 billionaires to Chinas 305.

Well, the top five years in terms of real median income in the US have been the last five years. The highest earning generation is Gen-X. We're also near historically low unemployment and Gen-X has the lowest unemployment rate of any generation.

It kind of sounds like Gen-X right now has it better than any generation in history. Congrats, y'all are the new Baby Boomers. And yes, someday that will likely be true for Millennials and Gen-Z. That's how things usually work in a growing economy.

But if you were ever annoyed when Baby Boomers would complain about how hard they had it when they were provably the most spoiled generation in history, then you might want to ease off the gen-x pity party right now. Y'all have it better than literally every other age group and that will only continue as wealth continues to pass from the Boomers to you guys.

And yes, you might have personal examples of friends that are exceptions to the trends in economic data. A few datapoints among hundreds of millions isn't really worth mentioning though.","4_1_1"

Reddit's journey from a college dorm room idea to a publicly traded entity capped off with a $6.4 billion IPO on Thursday, cementing its place as the newest social media company to go public.

Yet, Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder whose early vision shaped Reddit, was not among the beneficiaries of the corporate milestone, or the financial windfall attached to it. Ohanian, conspicuously absent from the company's S-1 filing and not listed among those owning more than a 5 percent stake, had parted ways with his ownership after selling Reddit to Condé Nast in 2006.

In high interest rate environments, they get paid enormously for sitting on their existing capital and doing nothing.

It is the same exact reason that red states take in more federal subsidies than they return in tax revenue and blue states return more in tax revenues than they take in subsidies. 

Measuring subsidies alone, blue states take in more than red states. Yet when we measure the amount taken in compared to federal tax revenue paid out blue states end up with a much larger positive tax revenue balance so that excess ends up subsidizing red state social programs.  You might think it would be the opposite. 

https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2FeBuDrkIah9UKDtvsoHAnV4YTZZN1oXJaVGE6lVlDPIk.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D485d0bd0dae95fd484260666885290310f666dd1

The reason is that direct subsidies to people at the bottom create the greatest amount of wealth because increasing the spending power of wage earners is subject to the multiplier effect.  The same effect that makes fractional reserve banking possible. 

So for every dollar injected into the bottom of the economy you get more than $10 dollars in return.  This boost in consumption increases revenues, profits, and tax revenues and increases the GDP. 

Raising wages, helicopter money, living subsidies, govt financed projects that raise wages or create jobs for the bottom all have the same effect.  You get back more than you give. 

Subsidies that do not increase the spending power of the bottom directly have the opposite effect. For every dollar spent you get less in return. So subsidies that go to firms or banks with the thought that they will pass this on to the public do not get passed on to the public, so they do not increase the marginal propensity to consume. 

The same is true of the nordic model countries. They know that homelessness is a cost center that only increases in cost the longer a person is homeless. When I say cost, I mean a cost in taxes that are not collected as a result of less consumption. 

The more homelessness you have, the less consumption you have thus the less tax revenue you generate.

If we take into account lost productivity and the social costs associated with homelessness, the cost of allowing someone to become homeless far outpaces the cost in subsidies you spend to keep them from being homeless. 

This does not take into account that the poverty ""escape wage"" is much higher than the nominal wage to keep someone from being destitute. 

In the USA the poverty escape wage is about $35 per hour.  The wage to keep someone out of poverty is about $27.00 per hour.","1_1_1_2_1"
