With the conflict in Ukraine and the U.S. shipping gas to Europe and expanding into China.

South and Central American countries are reliant on a higher price of oil.  A state like Venezuela is entirely dependent on a higher price of oil.

The U.S. has sanctions on Venezuela that negatively impacts its economy.

The U.S. while all this has been happening has not focused on cost of living increases or inflation.  We are on the brink of a major recession.  How we calculate consumer price increases and inflation was changed a few decades ago and the numbers being reported are not a good indication of the state of our economy.  The status of our economy has nothing to do with the strength of Wall Street.  The stock prices of 30-500 multi national corporations do not reflect the health of tens of millions of American businesses.

This is why the price of oil dropped, and what is contributing to the destabilization of South and Central American states leading to the increases in immigration.

If anyone wanted to solve the issue of immigration we would be removing the rest of the sanctions on Venezuela, and cutting production of oil and gas.

Preventing the manipulation by large business and banks of the market through their consolidation, creating manufactured supply line shortages.  Prices for fuel are already starting to increase again due to preventable refinery and infrastructure closures...This will lead to significant cost of living increases and shotgun everyone straight into a recession.

The U.S. should have significantly reduced the shipping of gas overseas and developed better relations with Venezuela at the start of Bidens administration, instead he went the other route.

The U.S. should also pressure Europe to take in refugees from and send increasing amounts of aid to their former African colonies that only gained independence in the 60s.  If the E.U. refuses to comply just stop sending aid and funding to pay for the deficit in costs caused by African immigration to the U.S.

Over 7 million immigrants have crossed the border under Biden and the Federal government are not providing the funds to manage their care, and their policies are guaranteed to generate significantly increased numbers.","2_4"

**[Donald Trump Built a National Debt So Big (Even Before the Pandemic) That Itll Weigh Down the Economy for Years](https://www.propublica.org/article/national-debt-trump)**

 &gt;After he took office, Trump predicted that economic growth created by the 2017 tax cut, combined with the proceeds from the tariffs he imposed on a wide range of goods from numerous countries, would help eliminate the budget deficit and let the U.S. begin to pay down its debt. On July 27, 2018, he told Sean Hannity of Fox News: We have $21 trillion in debt. When this [the 2017 tax cut] really kicks in, well start paying off that debt like its water.

&gt;Nine days later, he tweeted, Because of Tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 trillion in debt that has been accumulated, much by the Obama Administration.

&gt;Thats not how it played out. When Trump took office in January 2017, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was projecting that federal budget deficits would be 2% to 3% of our gross domestic product during Trumps term. Instead, the deficit reached nearly 4% of gross domestic product in 2018 and 4.6% in 2019.

Time and time again the GOP pretends to care about the debt but does worse than nothing about it when given power.","4"

If you want, we can add Clinton's 2 terms and H.W. Bush's 1 term to the comparison. In that case, there are five Democratic terms and four Republican terms. Even though the Democrats 'ruled' for one term more than the Republicans, which party added more to the national debt ? =	","9_2_1_1_1_1"

By percentage, California has the 10th largest month-over-month increase of jobs.

By percentage, year-over-year California is middle of the road at 26th in the nation.

Needless to say, I'm skeptical of this ad-ridden article that never explicitly states how they're measuring this claim that seems to run contrary to the available evidence. Even that article states a few things that seems to completely contradict the title's claim

&gt;""Yes, California  the nations largest job market  has consistently outperformed most states. Over 50 years, Californias 1.8% average annual growth ranks No. 19 and beats the 1.5% national pace.""

1) Corporations don't pay taxes. Any effort to make corporations pay higher taxes comes at the expense of consumers in the form of higher prices, the employees in the form of lower wages or in the stockholders in the form of lower dividends. 

2) Corporations don't get refunds. They are allowed to carry losses forward to offset profits in the future but Uncle Sam doesn't write ABC Corp a check if they lose money.

3) Corporate C Suite and CEOs are highly valued members of the corporate team charged with the responsibility to A) manage 100s or thousands of employees (for instance Amazon has 1.5 million people) B) oversees $Billions in assets, liabilities and revenue, and C) sets the strategic path for the business. Good ones are hard to come by, have 30+ years of experience and are compensated accordingly. 

4) Corporations have a fiduciary responsibility to the stockholder to maximize the value of the company NOT to address ""National Needs""   If the business is successful, national needs are met by the taxes the corporation pays in payroll taxes, property taxes, workers comp and unemployment taxes. employee benefits and in the payroll they contribute to their local community.","4"

Mass Modern Immigration is less about giving people an better life,its an business.

The most commonplace contract is the Singapore model,the worker has little to no chance to become an citizen, to bring his family in the country and he is literally exploited.

Mass Media is creating friction between working class people but in reality business owners(also known as ""lords"" here) are the only people winning from this arrangement.

As for keeping wages low,arguably business owners never intended to increases wages in the first place,either because they can't or they won't.

Now let's talk about the good type of immigration:since communism we had a lot of foreign students with the express focus to increase good relationships between us and underveloped nations.Right now palestinian national Raed Arafat is the head of SMURD,an special medical health division he created and saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

Foreign doctors or those of foreign origin are more highly regarded than romanian ones since they have higher work ethics,don't accept bribes and are more skilled.

So my point is that immigration can help certain people, not always the country or the immigrants in equal ways.If immigration is used as an tool for someone else's enrichment, then its an net negative.","1"

One is that it boosts our economy and employment and the other is that it hurts people in our economy but might create some winners even while it creates losers. The arguments get muddied by other values and I suspect this is why there is so much intellectual dishonesty instead of simply trying to mitigate the potentially harmful effects immigration has on some populations.

I think we're at the point where studies will show whatever the people funding them want them to show.

Immigration of skilled workers with jobs awaiting for them is clearly a benefit for the economy as a whole (but they so suppress wages for Americans) while uneducated undocumented and criminally unvetted immigrants is a different story with very different cost-benefit math. Just the cost of educating one child of undocumented immigrants is \~$20K/yr for 12 years, there's no way they pay that much in taxes.","9"

GDI has historically been the better indicator of the economy's health. 

There's also a divergence in the BLS's own establishment and household surveys. 

Analyst and former Federal Reserve advisor Danielle DiMartino Booth has discovered a 100% accurate concurrent recession indicator.

Her finding and that of Anna Wong, Bloomberg analyst is that the US recession started in October. 

It's a lot to digest but look up the doubleline roundtable prime 2024 with Danielle DiMartino Booth.

Sounds like this guy just doesn't want to have to pay to hire and train a diverse workforce, or have the US invest in equitable AND cutting edge technological development alongside economic growth.  We should all be glad he's not in charge of anything related to the public interest.

Maybe being exposed to more diverse perspectives would make him less of an idiot, though he's probably too rich to not have his head completely up his own ass.","1"

Might even be reasons not mentioned in the op-ed, but who cares.

TSMC or Samsung or whoever don't want to train workers, they don't want to sell chips. Cut them off from the U.S. market, full stop.

I am tired of this bullshit. If your company makes more money than a person can spend in thousands of years, you get as much pushback as you give.

And on a policy note, just because we build it here doesn't solve the original problem. If chipmakers take their people and go home later on, WE still don't know how to make the stuff because they balked at training anyone.

At the end of the day this is why these companies prefer bringing in their own employees - intellectual property rights. I'm not sure I blame them for that, but let's be honest about the motivations.","2"
