I think any comparison that ignores mortgage interest rates is missing something important.


In 1985 the average mortgage rate was 13%.  Assuming you financed the entire 83k average home price that means your monthly payment would have been around 900, which works out to about 47% of the stated annual income.


Assuming a 30 year at 7% in 2022 for the full median home price we get a payment of around 3k which works out to about 50% of the median income.


So, not that I'm on the side of boomers at all on this shit, but in a sense it is not that far off.  47% vs 50%.  You can definitely say homes are more expensive now, but it's hard to make the argument that it's all that drastic.


Things that a better analysis would consider is whether the median is a great measure in all cases here.  I imagine the distribution of home values and incomes looks a bit different now than it did in 85.  I would also like to know how property taxes, fees, insurance, and other costs of ownership factor in.  I have been in the market recently and we definitely have an affordability issue, but I'm not sure that this simple plot really provides much in understanding it.  Once you take mortgage rates into account it looks more or less on trend to me.","1_1_1"

In terms of luxury housing, some people do own multiple homes. Inequality is a major issue in the US.

That frees up their existing home for someone else, who moves and frees up another home. And so on.

&gt;One of the main problems with selling housing deregulation is the perception that new construction only benefits the rich.  Rich developers of course, but also rich home-buyers.  Its easy to see where casual observers get this idea.  New housing is usually nice housing, because over time technology improves and capital depreciates.  Since richer people are more willing to pay the upcharge for nicer housing, the future residents of new construction are usually well-to-do.

&gt;So what do casual observers miss?  They miss the big picture: People who move into new construction are moving away from older construction.  When they move, those older units become available for others.  While those others probably wont be drastically poorer than those they replace, they tend to be slightly poorer.  Think: one rung down.  When these slightly poorer people move, their prior dwellings will tend to be taken over by those who are a further rung down.  And so on, in a great chain reaction.  Allowing new construction really does help the whole income distribution.","2_1_5"

So the comparable  median income is $56,688 and the median home price would be $199,680.  So the  houses back then cost about 3.5 times annual salary. 
Now consider that the median home size in 1985 was 1,650 square feet.

Also, Im not sure why theyre using median instead of average.  The average home price in 2022 was only $348,000, not $468,000.  Also, home prices have already dropped significantly from their 2022 high. The 2023 median home price was only $417,700. 

The median home size in 2022 is 2,522 square feet, which is $165 per square foot. So if you were to buy a house in 2023 that was built in 2022, and was the same size as the houses in 1985, it would cost $272,500.  Or about 3.65 times your annual salary. 
So - almost no real difference from the situation in 1985.

I think the rest of your points are valid. The reason why median is used instead of average is because high home prices can introduce a bias that would inflate the average.


For example, if you have 5 homes: $250,000, $300,000, $350,000, $400,000, and $2.5M your average would be inflated to $770,000 which is nearly double the amount of 4 out of 5 homes. The median would be $350,000, which more accurately reflects the realistic prices expected for 4 out of 5 of those families who owned those homes.","18_2"

U.S. population in 2024: 342 million

Mechanization and trade has revolutionized U.S. food production, so agricultural workers now make up less than 2% of the U.S. worker population, compared to rough half in 1900. (This is why less than 1 in 10 illegal immigrant workers even toil in agriculture.) More and more rural small towns continue to empty out due to lack of job and other opportunities.

Automation and offshoring and trade means less than 8% of U.S. workers sweat it out in manufacturing, as opposed to the peak back in the late 1970s. Thousands of small factory towns across America have been hollowed out.

Computerization, offshoring, and AI means less and less need for knowledge workers. The peak was around the year 2000. And yet even though perhaps 1 in 10 adult Americans had a bachelors degree were higher back in the 1970s, 1 in 3 do now, and amongst Millennials it is roughly 1 in 2. This is why a significant portion of college graduates are working at jobs that do not require college degree at all.

The vast majority (over 90%) of net new jobs created in the U.S. over the past 20+ years have been of the kinds that are part time, temporary, lower paid, few oe no benefits, gigs or apps-based.

The overall trend is, fewer and fewer good paying jobs and exponentially explosive population growth - whether through reproduction, people living and working longer, or immigration (both legal and illegal).

Some clueless people proclaim that the United States is a very large country and there is lots of space. But all the jobs and desirable housing or concentrated.

That kind of concentration means intense competition for jobs and intense competition for housing.

When labor is scarce, wages rise, better benefits are offered, full time positions are offered.

When labor supply is oversaturated, employers (buyers or labor) can offer lower wages, offer fewer benefits, etc.

This is true in the overall labor market, and for specific skill sets. I remember even back in the 1990s, college graduates with.degrees in library science, biology, and English were struggling for jobs in their fields, though at least they could find some decent jobs. But theres also goes for manufacturing work, warehouse work, transportation, hospitality, food service, groundskeeping and maintenance, etc.

The current classic example is ride sharing and delivery apps. Youve got everyone competing: seniors, college students and college graduates, high school graduates and high school dropouts, single parents and stay-at-home parents, immigrants (legal and illegal with fake IDs), etc.

Same with housing. You wonder how people can afford housing? Many young adults are living with parents are combining money as roommates to bid on housing. When I was last renting in Southern California, we had upstairs neighbors who were three young women, each with their respective boyfriends. before that, in a condo I was renting there were 3 immigrant families occupying the 3-bedroom condo next to us, and on thr other side, 2 families occupied a 2-bedroom unit. The math is simple: 1 or 2 working adults are not going to have an easy time competing for housing against 6 adults earning even if thr 6 each earn less money.

Its all about supply and demand and all about math.

If you want to see the situation get worse, which is what anyone can predict will continue to happen, just continue our current policies.","23"

People do not need granite or quartz countertops. Formica is affordable, looks fine, and was common per 2005.

You do not need custom made old growth cabinets. 

Linoleum flooring will need to return to some extent in favor of wood or tile.

Glass shower enclosures will need to vanish in favor of good old fashion shower curtains.

Appliances will have to be more generic.

Basements (where they exist) will need to be unfinished.

You probably will have to settle for cheap builder grade fixtures as well rather than brushed steel or oil rubbed bronze.

Ceiling fans will need to be plain Jane basic where they are included at all.

These are All things homeowners can upgrade themselves over time. The instant gratification has to end.

We all say we want starter homes. Then builders make them and every single home is upgraded to the hilt. 

This has happened in two sub 300k new build neighborhoods in KC in the past five years. The models and choices were priced from 225 on up.
Not one actually sold for below 300k and many are now pushing 400k due to upgrades&. All of which are change orders and are marked up significantly beyond what they would be as standard options.

Trust me when I say these are NOT worth 400k. 

For that starting price you get an extra 1000+sqft, larger lots and homes that are standard with all the highly marked up upgrades, plus more. (Walk-in closets, wood floors, fireplaces, zones heating/cooling, custom fixtures, a huge appliance allowance, and guest rooms that are larger than most master bedrooms.

Starter homes were, well, small. like 800-1000 square foot small. Their lots were also much smaller. Like 3,000-4,000 square feet. You want to swap between quartz to formica? Wow you saved like 700 dollars on a 300-400k house. And the only issue is it's not as durable and not nearly as nice looking in quite literally the most important area of the entire house (based on consumer preferences). Cabinets are expensive as hell if they're real hardwood, but virtually no homes being built as part of developments are putting in maple cabinets. 

If you want to save money the single biggest thing is reducing square footage and depending on market, lot size. T**he biggest cost is not materials, but labor.** Cheaping out on materials generally does not result in significant savings.

  
Basically you can make a 2500 square foot house no one wants to live in  (formica, cheap carpet etc.) for 90% of the cost of a new 2,500 square foot house with nice finishes, or you make a 1,500 square foot house with identical finishes for 70% of the cost. Builders overstate the upgrade cost because they want to be able to say ""starting in the 250s"" or whatever, but know no one actually is going to build the base house. We almost bought a new build and if we had it was actually cheaper to buy the house with the ultra cheap carpet and pay someone else to dispose of it and replace it with hardwood for the price they wanted LVP. The actual upgrades are like 60% of the cost lennar etc. wants.

There are a few new build smaller houses being built around the country, but most people when faced with high housing cost just commute more from a worse area, or buy a crappy house and save up until they can remodel it.","1_3_1_1_1_1_1"

Just a reminder: none of the charming main streets and downtowns that everyone loves could have been built under current zoning laws.

President Joe Biden this week said he has a plan to build 2 million new homes, part of his efforts to increase the supply of houses in the market which he believes is key towards improving affordability.

Prospective homeowners have struggled to afford getting into the housing market amid record-high mortgage rates and high prices. A limited supply of houses has led to increased competition which has led to increased buying costs.

&gt;1) Increases in housing supply slow the growth in rents in the region; 2) In some circumstances, new construction also reduces rents or rent growth in the surrounding area; 3) The chains of moves sparked by new construction free up apartments that are then rented (or retained) by households across the income spectrum; 4) While new supply is associated with gentrification, it has not been shown to cause significant displacement of lower income households; and 5) Easing land use restrictions, at least on a broad scale and in ways that change binding constraints on development, generally leads to more new housing over time, but only a fraction of the new capacity created because many other factors constrain the pace of new development.

In summary, remove supply side constraints -&gt; lower prices. Its pretty simple supply and demand, and frankly its a little weird that we seem to need studies to show us that; nevertheless, here we are.

Also worth noting, while its popular (and probably politically smart) to talk about corporate ownership of housing, [the reality is it really just doesn't matter that much](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4480261). Like, its probably worth throwing something like that in, because people will really love it and it will help the politics of the situation (you will hurt renters a little and cause some gentrification, but those effects seem marginal compared to the positive politics).

According to this article, my information was indeed wrong, EVs do offset more than ICEs fuel consumption, even considering production of it. However, the problem here is that simply offsetting what ICE cars would consume still means that you are polluting, and our environment is already collapsing, so building billions of EVs to phase out ICE cars would create more problems, it would not solve the problem.

&gt;The capitalism system is merely an economic method to trade goods and services efficiently, it doesn't control or push for more production. The human condition and societal demands do. 

That is completely incorrect. The capitalist system demands growth, because without growth there is crisis.

For example, recessions are simply a slow down of growth, and that already creates massive problems for our society, imagine what negative growth would look like in a capitalist system. Normally negative growth only happens after catastrophes, like wars, or extreme climatic events.

The large company likely hire qualified scientist/engineer to ensure the good quality of the toothpaste, and good accountant/specialist to comply with the necessary regulation. Whereas if I buy it from a small family business, it may be more expensive, with worse quality control.

eBay is a little more likely to sell you something with at least a relatively regular American middle man. Etsy, too. Just not Amazon or Walmart. I've bought from so many random websites over the years and never got anything less than I ordered. 

Try to search for American and union made things. Admittedly not easy. And insanely more expensive. Most union brands are kept alive by union tradesmen. Everything is made to last a lifetime. My grandfather is passing on work boots he wore for 30 years on the job. Only my lesbian cousin could fit into them but still. 

You have to look at fine print. Payed $75 for Thorogood brand converse looking high tops. I had googled what shoe companies still used American Union Labor. They do. Got shoes, ""made in China"" Apparently only their original signature boots are made here. Shoes are ugly, like oversized for converse, like how a toddler or baby's shoes are oversized by scale. I'm 6'5"" and it's still off.","26"

Here is another look, OP (/u/obamascrocss):

U.S. population in 1970: 295 million  
U.S. population in 2024: 342 million

Mechanization and trade has revolutionized U.S. food production, so agricultural workers now make up less than 2% of the U.S. worker population, compared to rough half in 1900. (This is why less than 1 in 10 illegal immigrant workers even toil in agriculture.) More and more rural small towns continue to empty out due to lack of job and other opportunities.

Automation and offshoring and trade means less than 8% of U.S. workers sweat it out in manufacturing, as opposed to the peak back in the late 1970s. Thousands of small factory towns across America have been hollowed out.

Computerization, offshoring, and AI means less and less need for knowledge workers. The peak was around the year 2000. And yet even though perhaps 1 in 10 adult Americans had a bachelors degree were higher back in the 1970s, 1 in 3 do now, and amongst Millennials it is roughly 1 in 2. This is why a significant portion of college graduates are working at jobs that do not require college degree at all.

The vast majority (over 90%) of net new jobs created in the U.S. over the past 20+ years have been of the kinds that are part time, temporary, lower paid, few oe no benefits, gigs or apps-based.

The overall trend is, fewer and fewer good paying jobs and exponentially explosive population growth - whether through reproduction, people living and working longer, or immigration (both legal and illegal).

Some clueless people proclaim that the United States is a very large country and there is lots of space. But all the jobs and desirable housing or concentrated.

That kind of concentration means intense competition for jobs and intense competition for housing.

When labor is scarce, wages rise, better benefits are offered, full time positions are offered.

When labor supply is oversaturated, employers (buyers or labor) can offer lower wages, offer fewer benefits, etc.

This is true in the overall labor market, and for specific skill sets. I remember even back in the 1990s, college graduates with.degrees in library science, biology, and English were struggling for jobs in their fields, though at least they could find some decent jobs. But theres also goes for manufacturing work, warehouse work, transportation, hospitality, food service, groundskeeping and maintenance, etc.

The current classic example is ride sharing and delivery apps. Youve got everyone competing: seniors, college students and college graduates, high school graduates and high school dropouts, single parents and stay-at-home parents, immigrants (legal and illegal with fake IDs), etc.

Same with housing. You wonder how people can afford housing? Many young adults are living with parents are combining money as roommates to bid on housing. When I was last renting in Southern California, we had upstairs neighbors who were three young women, each with their respective boyfriends. before that, in a condo I was renting there were 3 immigrant families occupying the 3-bedroom condo next to us, and on thr other side, 2 families occupied a 2-bedroom unit. The math is simple: 1 or 2 working adults are not going to have an easy time competing for housing against 6 adults earning even if thr 6 each earn less money.

Its all about supply and demand and all about math.

If you want to see the situation get worse, which is what anyone can predict will continue to happen, just continue our current policies.","1_1"

Central to the American ethos is the notion of a thriving middle class as the cornerstone of the American dream. This dream envisions that anyone armed with a high school diploma and a strong work ethic could effortlessly attain a comfortable lifestylea nice suburban home, two cars, and an annual family vacation to a desirable destination. Many Americans view this as an inherent entitlement, believing that such prosperity has always been the norm and a divine right.



However, the reality of an exceedingly affluent middle class, surpassing global standards, is not the typical course of events. It is instead a consequence of unique historical circumstances, particularly the aftermath of World War II. Following the war, the United States emerged as the sole major industrial power with its industry and infrastructure largely unscathed. This bestowed upon the US a significant economic advantage, as other nations relied heavily on American goods and services.



In the post-World War II era, businesses worldwide had little choice but to purchase American products for their needs, driving capital flow into American enterprises. However, this prosperity was also facilitated by concessions made to labor unions due to the scarcity of highly skilled American workers, leading to remarkable growth and affluence in the US middle class during the 1950s and 1960s.



Over time, however, other industrial powers recovered and began challenging American dominance in the global market. Competition intensified as countries such as Germany, Japan, Belgium, Britain, the Netherlands, France, and others entered the fray. Additionally, newly industrialized nations like Brazil, South Africa, India, China, Mexico, Thailand, Turkey, South Korea, and more began vying for resources to fuel their own growth, altering the dynamics of global trade.



Consequently, the once-exclusive advantage of the American workforce diminished as other nations developed comparable capabilities, eroding the bargaining power of American workers and labor unions. Moreover, globalization enabled manufacturers to engage in global wage arbitrage by relocating production to countries with cheaper labor, further weakening the position of American workers.



The unsustainable nature of the American middle-class lifestyle, characterized by high consumption and resource demands, became apparent. Earth's resources are finite, and if global consumption mirrored that of the average American, it would exceed the planet's capacity by multiple folds.



The decline of the US middle class stems from these structural shifts in the global economy, and political solutions cannot reverse the course of globalization. The notion of returning to the ""good old days"" is a fallacy perpetuated by politicians on both sides of the aisle.



Moving forward, the American middle class will likely resemble its counterparts worldwide, necessitating adjustments in expectations and lifestyles. While inequality remains a pressing issue, efforts toward wealth redistribution should focus on areas such as healthcare affordability and urban livability rather than attempts to revive an outdated version of the middle class lifestyle. Embracing a model akin to other countries' middle classes, coupled with robust social services and safety nets, offers a more realistic path forward.","5"

California's jobs market has been struggling, despite the U.S. economy booming, with the state trailing behind the rest of the country for job growth and reporting a higher unemployment rate than the national average.

In December 2023, the latest data made available by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), California had 830,000 job openings. While higher month-over-monthwith 751,000 openings the month beforethe number was much lower than a year prior, when it stood at 1,244,000 in December 2022.

Homes, stocks, cars, food, gas, etc.  The winners were the ones who owned those things that went up (rich Boomers) and the losers (poor Millennials and Gen-Z) were the ones who were forced to buy those things with ever weaker dollars.

If we treated the pandemic like WW2, we would have asked citizens to choose austerity until the crisis was over which would have cost less and allowed spending to return back to normal.

Instead, we've normalized that level of spending (current spending is 50% more than 2019 even though crisis is over) and guaranteed cost of living to continue to remain high and go higher over time.","4"

Lottery shops in China are ditching bland storefronts to reinvent themselves as hipster hangouts, with slogans that tempt youngsters hit by an economic slowdown with the lure of getting rich quick.

We should still have dreams, who knows one day they may come true? reads one sign at one lottery store in Chongqing, in southwestern China. With sleek outside seating styled like a trendy cafe, its tagline is more than just a lottery shop.

Another Lotto Coffee store in Kunming, capital of the southwestern province of Yunnan, promised a free scratch ticket with every coffee purchase. A cup of coffee with good luck, said a slogan on the wall.

The problem is that with free money people can begin a bidding cycle of accumulation. Imagine for a moment everybody gets 10 USD's because that is what you need to live. Somebody being clever says, ""hey I don't mind eating less and wearing paper clothes so I will use my monies to buy something I really want.""  What they really want they are willing to bid up for. The person who sells the really want can say, ""hey let me increase the price"".  Thus the seller gets more money, and now can start their own accumulation of out bidding the other person.

If you were to give more and more and more free money then you will keep increasing the quantity and increasing the prices because people will keep out bidding each other.

You could argue, ""stop that you don't do that, the state will say this is X, and this is Y.""  What you just created is communism. Communism is not where everyone is equal, but you give all that you can and only take what you need. In essence it is the theory of Jesus. I am not kidding here. You remove the idea of bidding and accumulation. You give everything what people want.

Ok the problem... You give everything what people want. The problem is that people are greedy and people want power. Thus communism does not work. I don't know how much you know about Star Trek, but Star Trek is the communist ideal. Ferengis are who we are today. In Star Trek there is no money, there is never talk about power and accumulation. There is talk about adventure and bettering your own person. 

The fact that you feel bad is good, and IMO you are the right person for the job. Somebody who would be comfortable doing your job and having no problem taking money from poor people is the problem of our society.  So two thumbs up for asking the question... I think you are a good person.","2"

The U.S. budget is not equivalent to a household budget. The world runs on dollars and if you are the government that issues dollars, you get to do what you want. Military spending is 3.5% of GDP.

Never mind whether this is good or bad or should/shouldn't and all that. If you're on top, you do what you can to stay on top. A shit-ton of national debt is kind of a shrug when you get to do what you want; if you're not on top, you'll have issues, so stay on top.

Well we used to do more of it... but it's basically due to increasingly powerful private individuals and organizations looking at the loss of revenue that would result if we did set up single payer healthcare or free college. Over the decades there have been many government sponsored programs that have slowly been transitioned to private business interests. We've been told it was to save noney on the deficit or to make things more efficient or (my favorite) give consumers more choices to save money.

That's it - we spend what we do and where we do to remain #1. We don't spend on things to help more people because that would result in lower profit margins for the S&amp;P 500.","4"

The efficiency of that funding may be greater than, sadly, a smaller population of cancer victims. 

The printing of more money can devalue the dollar due to inflationary response of doing so...  so it's actually important to ensure taxation and proper debt balancing with credit-worthy bodies. I thought we could just print infiniteomey too, and I don't think the good provided would actually devalue the dollar enough for those who are in need. 

My guess, right now, is that EU and Middle East feel unstable, and US is a great exporter of military goods and services, so our government leans on that to debt finance our allies (and likely our enemies too). Depending on the credit worthiness of those countries, the US stands to increase the value of its dollar, or to gain in interest from those countries. I'm not sure I know how to explain this well enough...

Whereas there is no direct benefit to debt financing those who need the charity money - they likely aren't credit worthy enough... It's sad, but true. 

With the last statement -- but just to caveat that I'm still figuring out how to explain this myself and may over  generalize here -- crony capitalism plays into this... While some may say the standard of living has or is getting better more broadly (this may be challenged more recently), lack of progressive tax policy is leaving behind the lower and middle classes due to the response (inflation) of printing too much money, and that money being in the hands of the ultra wealthy to invest in things that will continue to increase profit. Where do the needy fit into this equation? The answer: they don't...

So charities are there as an 'altruistic' tax, not enforced by government policy, but perhaps beneficial with tax credits for some. 

I would be interested to see the correlation of charity $ volume during more versus less wealth inequality in the US. 

If your charity serves people in other countries, then that may just be another channel for supplying aid... In a way, it's through a tax system, not just simply printing money. If it is through printing money and sending it across, there should be some deal to pay it back (and generally serving needy populations can pay back if the government of the needy is not corrupt). In the case where debt cannot be paid back, political conflict can errupt. Jeffrey Sachs describes this in ""The End of Poverty"".

1) We don't print money to fund the military. We print money to pay for deficit spending which is ALL government spending that is more than revenue.

2) It would be nice if we could just print money to pay for all the things we want but printed money causes inflation and I think we all agree that we don't like inflation.

3) We do have a resource problem. There is a finite amount of income we can tax and the history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business and invest it in tax-exempt securities or to find other lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income.

Republicans and Democrats plans to stabilize Social Security and Medicare could not be farther apart.  For concrete or analytical thinkers, especially those who are younger, and may not appreciate the level of energy it takes to work past a certain age, Republicans plan seems good.  Just raise the retirement age or, as Senator Rick Scott proposed, just sunset Medicare and Social Security if they dont get the votes.  Keep giving corporations large tax cuts and cut funding to the IRS that is going after wealthy tax cheats and, in their words, all will be good.  This, of course, is not a serious plan for the American people.

Corporations received an enormous tax break in 2017. While their profits soared, their investment in their workers did not.  Their shareholders and top executives reaped the benefits without the promised trickle down.

President Bidens Fiscal Year 2025 Budget would set the corporate tax rate at 28 percent, still well below the 35 percent rate prior to the 2017 tax law.  

President Bidens Budget also includes a 25% minimum tax on the wealthiest 0.01 percent.  Already, the IRS has collected more than $500 million in unpaid taxes and launched enforcement action against 25,000 millionaires who have not filed a tax return since 2017.  

It is shocking that anyone would oppose making corporations and millionaires pay their fair share to help reduce the federal deficit and stabilize safety nets that Americans have paid into for decades. Any effort to push the Social Security age to an age closer to the end of life expectancy, or to sunset safety nets, is a theft of the American people who have paid into these systems for decades.","4"

He claims one of the reasons it's done this way is because across the world economists have been sent to the US for study, and they want them trained in neoliberal mindsets so as to keep the current order.  Most people simply can't question the established narrative.

I am not an economist but I value Michael Hudson's voice, as it's fairly unique and intelligent to boot.","2"

Creates a lot of cognitive bias, including the bias in not seeing it.  

It's hard to imagine an education system that would be better in creating such blind spots while not being too obvious about it.","2_1_1"
