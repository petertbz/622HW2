Engineers there are not happy about the condition of their processes.  They know what needs to be done to fix things but the engineers are not in charge and lack power to change things that need to change.  That's really bad.

They're going to need an engineer to take over that is willing to tell investors to hold while fixing these problems for the long term.  I don't think that is very likely.

So, we'll see a decline over time. Something will go wrong, there'll be an expensive fix, and a year of heightened focus on improving process then cost cuttings and another problem...this will go on for a long time until Boeing becomes untouchable and something very dramatic happens like a fire sale just before bankruptcy 8-10 years down the road after a handful of avoidable tragedies.","3_1"

You're over here soapboxing on political issues and I'm simply saying this is hardly an issue that should concern the public.  I doubt Boeing is in a huge amount of trouble--the FAA investigates all mechanical failures like this regardless of whether the public grandstands about it or not, and just as with every other time, they continue to press these manufacturers and operators to clean their shit up. Short of that, operators are going to use every single incident like this as leverage against manufacturers to discount the purchase price of new airplanes, and that's going to pressure Boeing *even further* to fix any recurring quality issues. 

Bottom line is for people like you and me, the risk profile of picking a 737 MAX over a different airframe is measured by the millionths of a single percent. It's a non-issue. 

Take a look at aircraft failure rates, injury rates, and fatality rates around the world.  For all the ""ree corporate corruption dystopia"" the US (and then the EU) have the safest track record with commercial flight, despite *massively* out-flying every single other nation in the world.  

Suggesting that this infrastructure is killing people trying to visit their grandparents is absolutely and objectively overdramatic. We aren't anywhere *close* to that, and it's concerning to see people upvoting such asinine rhetoric. But I guess emotions &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; math. Outrage feels good. Or whatever.","3_2_1_1"

Thats just the aerospace industry at work, were just paying attention to it now. The planes are still extremely safe to fly. Commercial airliners occasionally have maintenance issues regardless of manufacturer, and thats almost always on the airliner who owns and operates the planes. Boeing planes alone have carried out hundreds of millions of commercial flights since their last fatal accident caused by the plane. I have personally flown on the MAX 9 itself multiple times in the last month. Youll be fine on any commercial plane you fly. 

What youre seeing with the maintenance issues is a transitory media cycle providing extra attention to regular maintenance incidents that happen and arent necessarily dangerous to the passengers because the aerospace industry is designed with handling these incidents in mind from the ground up.

Boeing as a company obviously has issues with its leadership that need to be addressed because they are allowing QA issues like the door plug to slip through the cracks because it saves money (and the whistleblower situation is quite suspect) but the planes themselves are extremely safe to fly on still. Airbus and Boeing both still maintain extremely high safety standards statistically overall.","20_1"

As you know, opening a restaurant is no easy task. Between picking a location, getting permits, dealing with health code, remodeling, buying the proper equipment, hiring and training, marketing, etc. it's a lot of work and there are right and wrong ways to do it.

You could work as a consultant for people wanting to open up their own place. You could walk them through all the steps of opening their shop up, or for a higher price, you could do all the ground work of opening up a new spot. Will it be a pain? Probably. But you wouldn't have to deal with the day-to-day headaches of running your own shop. Once you get everything set up for the restaurateur, its up to them to deal with that, unless they hire you again for consulting, at which point, you just come in and assess their shortcomings and give them guidance on how to improve. 

I don't know if you were running franchises or if they were your own fast food places, but if they were your own, there's a lot more opportunity for suggesting things. From personalization of design, to building the menu.","2_1_1"

From there it was only up and up. They would want pics, to do phone calls, etc, and my wife and I were puling in about 2K a week.  My gf provided any verification pics I needed and when people asked for pics she would do them as soon as she could.

I wanted to start expanding and hiring chatters.  I created a discord server for all of the chatters to keep them i one place and so I can teach them how to chat.

If he tries to understand things and you don't feel like it's your job to teach him, tell him to inform himself on his own time, or provide him with the necessary resources.

If he tries to ask questions to potentially find flaws and thus give you a chance to improve a process, product or angle, tell him that he's not in charge of process management and that he is free to hand in written feedback and recommendations after hours. Inform him, that you (or the employee in charge of process management) will review and utilize his feedback - if you/they think there's something to it.

If his questions are purely smalltalk and there is no potential upside to them, it is likely that he'll figure that out when you keep asking him what he is trying to accomplish by asking the question - REPEATEDLY. If he still continues asking them, tell him to stop.
