Transportation is 16%, with gas prices being about half that (I think?). 

Rent doesnt seem to be coming down quickly, and with high mortgage rates, increasing homeowners insurance, and increasing taxes, landlords cant afford to drop rent prices yet until the demand is drastically reduced to the point their houses arent getting rented. 

Gas prices have increased 40 cents on average YTD (3.05 to 3.45, 13% increase). According to Connoco Phillips ceo, this will continue. 

Anybody see inflation coming down to 2% goal this year? What impact do you think this has on the stock market? Cheap money being pushed out means expected returns wont increase as soon as expected. ","inflation",3,3,0,0.62,0,0,0,12
