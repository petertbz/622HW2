You are a TOTAL IDIOT and envious of what others have. 

The basic definition of farming is nothing but hard work and manual labor for generations to bring you the food that you eat. What an entitled and lazy point of view. Everything that you buy at the grocery store was literally grown by someone else, so you could just buy it ( probably with your food stamps that YOU DIDN'T EARN). 

And how you got ""White privilege"" out of farming is crazy. The privilege to perform manual labor is passed on to your children so they can perform manual labor. SOUNDS SO PRIVILEGED! >*","1_1_4_1_1_2_2_4"

""this"" isn't very descriptive.  Everything except for the bottom piece ""SC - Withholding"" which is the state income tax portion would be exactly the same as it would have been in KY.  KY has a fixed 4.5% income tax, where SC is a graduated income tax that is realistically 6.4% for all but the lowest income workers (&lt;$16,000/year).

The other pieces are all a percentage of your earnings, and yes, that $4000 moving allowance is part of your earnings, so you have to pay taxes on that.  You are paying a percentage on the $6884.80 number.  Next check, you'll pay a percentage on $2884.80.

You can then expect the following (my estimates given $2884.80 is 41.9% of $6884.80):

Federal Withholding: $509.50 (realistically more like $336.96 accounting for the bracket changes)

SS: 178.85

Medicare: 41.83

SC - Withholding: 172.52

What likely happened was the moving allowance was initially coded as income in their pay stub software (save all moving receipts! Trucks, supplies, registrations,etc to deduct on taxes!). Most companies calculate withholding taxes as if you normally make whatever you earned that pay period every week of the year. This likely artificially raised you into a higher tax bracket, but wont be permanent. Youll get it back when you file your return next year.","38"
