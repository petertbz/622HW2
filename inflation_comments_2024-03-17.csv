Same basic idea, but it requires a large pool of desperate workers. And at the very, very bottom of the economy there are fewer of those right now. 

And Dollar stores are the absolute bottom. There's a handful of jobs ex-cons and undocumented immigrants get stuck with that are worse and not much else.","1_1_1"

Here are a few items for $1.25 that your local market is probably not providing at even 50-75% higher prices:

UHT Milk  (Shelf stable, cow, oat or almond)
Tortillas
Whole wheat bread
Frozen food single servings like Jamaican Chicken or beef patties
Garden seeds (4 packs for $1) 
Bleach &amp; Cleaning supplies

The quality is on par with the mid or lower tier brands at most markets and still considerably cheaper as most stores mark these items up to double or triple what the same thing costs in a Dollar Tree

You really don't though.  You clearly are one of those people who think that the national economy is synonymous with your personal finances.  Like being in debt on your house is the same thing as being in debt as a country. 

Despite all the evidence that shows they're not equivalent in any way, your mind is not receptive to the fact that they aren't the same.  Society grows, population grows, your house population does not. Technological investments pay off on a national scale, not on your personal bank account scale. 

This is all just to provide small examples of how your ideas are based on grossly uneducated axioms, whether you've said them or not, it's clear you're on that same level from your discourse so far.

I've stopped going to McDonald's or any other fast food place. It felt like a total rip off, to be paying a higher price for trashy food. 

Pay your workers more, that's great. But, if you try to cover the cost by raising prices, rather than taking the loss in margin, I'm not buying your crap. 

When you abandon your value proposition to increase margin, don't be surprised when your clientele dumps you for something with better value.

The last time I went to fast food, it cost $50 to feed 4 people. I can go to a decent restaurant for $80, or go for steaks at Texas Roadhouse for $100. 

I'm basically saying that McFood is not worth paying for, so I save my money and eat at home until I want something that's much better quality for the price.

If McDonald's disappeared overnight and people cooked for themselves grocery stores would need more staff and they pay better than fast food. It's a societal good. Health care costs would drop. 

Stop eating fast food.","3"

On the open market beef is $3-$4/lb for buying a whole cow. Probably $3/lb for McDonalds. For a quarter pounder thats 75 cents per burger in just beef. Nevermind labor costs, buns, toppings, building costs, management fees, franchise fees, taxes. And nevermind most fast food doesnt make much if anything on the food, they make their money in the drinks.","24_2"
