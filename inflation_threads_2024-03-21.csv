Inflation would make 6500 dollars worth about 18,000 today.

Most of the ""cheaper"" cars now have 25,000 dollar sticker prices, and BS dealer add-ons push them to almost 30 grand.  I heard recently there are only 7 car models being sold for less than 25 grand.

I havent been to a Dennys since the before sh*t hit the fan in 2020. I stopped over to get some work done while I wait for my gf to get out of work, I figured it was a cheap place to have a meal and work on some code.. holy sh*t though!! This used to be the place Id come to while I was in college where Id spend no more than $15 after taxes and everything.
