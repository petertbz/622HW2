Here the question. Assume a small business with an annual TO of 1 Million (USD/ Pounds etc) requires additional/unexpected access to cash what is the typical approach used:  
1- Use emergency ""savings"" held in the business  
2- Approach the bank  
3- Approach non-bank institutions (other finance houses)  
4- Consider additional investor funding or getting private investor for capital expansion  
For context I will use the following example:  
Company A - which is an engineering company within the mining sector just landed a lucrative contract which will require an additional 2-3 million in working capital, however the funds ain't readily available, how would they go about raising said funds for the project - based on options listed.  
I am especially interested in the option around approaching non-bank institutions for funding.

In addition - which platforms do you use to find your options available for obtaining finance (social media, versus googling finance houses and enquiring around rates etc)

Business A would have multistate nexus for sales tax and files/remits accordingly.

Business B would only have nexus in the state it operates in.

Would I be at risk for noncompliance with states saying Business B was not distinct from business A and thus Business B also should have been collecting and remitting sales tax?

Is there anyway to make these businesses absolutely distinct/seperate legally? They would have different llc, fein, bank account, etc but all inventory sold by business B would be bought from business A and both businesses share same address/ownership. They just have different sales markets (marketplaces vs own website/in person sales) thus minimizing legal liability.","business",1,1,0,0.99,0,0,0,0

I run a Small Business specializing in Snacks and want to ask what is the best place/Websites in US or Alibaba etc. website vendors to get Custom Packaging.

I have very low margins already and so I cannot spend much on packaging. So Cheapest would be better, yet the ability to customize the Design.

How has your experience been with the Chinese vendors on Alibaba etc? Are they reliable in terms of costs down the road and the timeliness of delivery every time?

I wont dive deep into the types of businesses or what industry theyd be in since thats kinda of irrelevant at the moment (or so I think), but below is a general idea of what Id like to do.

Under my name as a Sole Proprietor Id own multiple business, all of which would operate under their own Brand and Trademark and have no ties to one another in terms of business operations.  Id be the only owner and there wouldnt be any additional employees under each of the businesses.

Heres my question(s)  if each of the businesses had their own DBA (or LLC.) and I wanted to then create an umbrella-type company that owns all of those business mentioned above, how would I go about that?  Example: Proctor &amp; Gamble, how they own numerous different brands underneath them.

"" Would I just need to create an LLC. for the umbrella company (waits for the Resident Evil reference) and then shift all of the Brands ownership over from my name to the larger company?

"" Would all of the smaller businesses still need their own individual DBA/LLC. even if theyre owned under the larger umbrella company, which would have an LLC. and/or something equivalent?

Im fairly new to all of this, so any and all advice, guidance or wisdom is greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Ryan","business",0,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,1

Im still in the research and preparation stage of choosing to start my own business or buy into a franchise. I have my start-up funds ready to go. But I am being plagued by indecision paired with intimidation of failure.

I have no experience running a business so Im wondering if buying a franchise would be better since it comes with tested framework and tools for business essential operations. Essentially, running a business with training wheels that can ease me into understanding how the business ownership world operates. I understand, the whole buying a job aspect which is making me second guess my decision with a franchise not to mention the limited ROI, and freedom to make decisions.

Starting my personal business has a huge intimidation aspect for me along with every field Im looking at getting into being impacted I.e. junk removal, marketing, mobile food service, and starting a clothing brand.

Id greatly appreciate any words of advice, encouragement, or recommendations on how to proceed.

TYIA!

EDIT: The franchise I'm looking at buying into is a small regional food service. Is is by no means an international/household name.","business",0,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,9
