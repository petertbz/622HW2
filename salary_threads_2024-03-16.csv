Relocation assistance causing this maybe ?","Salary",180,180,0,0.86,0,0,0,329

We have a 5 year pay progression that starts off stupid low for the industry but also has the highest top rate in the industry. In 2019 I took a massive pay cut to come here, went from $45 an hour to $26 an hour. Start pay is non-negotiable, most mechanics take a huge pay cut to come here. I made the move because the contract at the last company was bad and would limit my future pay. Id be at $49 an hour there right now if I still worked there. With the current company I went from $26 to $39 and change over the last 5 years and then my pay jumped to $69.74 on my 5 year mark. Current contract will put me at $75 an hour by May 2026. Aside from hourly pay, the company contributes 16% into my retirement accounts (last company was only 8%). Medical is free for the entire family with a $300 deductible and my last company would be $500 a month with $1500 deductible now.

It was tough for a few years, especially since we had our first kid in 2019 and my wife stopped working. But luckily I bought a cheap house back in 2014 and never had car loans or any debt so it was manageable. This new job also allowed us to sell our house in a HCOL area and move to the Midwest because my pay stays the same anywhere in the country. I also have a 3 day work week now, which is great for the family. Even if I pick up some shifts like I did in this check, I still get 2-3 days off. ","Salary",8,8,0,0.91,0,0,0,3

","Im about to do a second interview for a role and Im a little unsure on how best to tackle the salary discussion and also where my expectations should be at. 

For context, Im Australian and have recently relocated to Berlin. I was on about 75k (AUD) in my last role. By Australian standards, I was probably a little underpaid and had I stayed in the country I would have left my role and looked for something around the 90k mark. Australian wages are generally quite high but so is the cost of living. 

However, I wanted to go overseas so I left and now Im here. The role that Im looking at now is reasonably similar-ish to my last role. In the first interview, they asked my salary expectations and I answered honestly - I said it was a difficult question to answer as I wasnt sure how my salary translated in Europe and asked her for a range. She responded by saying she would have to check with HR but the last time they had hired for the role it was around 42k (EUR) which is about 69k in AUD. So this would be a 6k pay cut. 

The other thing which is important to add is that there are a couple of conditions with this job which are super ideal for me right now - its remote, its reasonably cruisy, and theyre happy to sponsor me once my working holiday visa runs out in December, which means it gives me the certainty of knowing I can stay here once my visa is finished. The remote thing gives me a bit more freedom to travel on the weekends and it also means I still have time to go to German classes and focus on learning the language, which is really important to me. So Im nervous to push it too much and lose the job. 

So - what do I do? How do I try and get the salary as close to my former salary without ruining my chances of getting the job? Any advice would be hugely appreciated - thanks in advance! ","Salary",2,2,0,1,0,0,0,0
"6","https://www.reddit.com/r/Salary/comments/1bggjaz/bonus_pay_out_is_weird/","nowhereisaguy","2024-03-16",1710624289,"Bonus Pay Out is weird ","So my gross bonus is 15% of my salary. Roughly 40k. I netted only 20k but was over 100% on every metric other than company profit. Which was at 94% and was 20% weighted.  So I should have grossed 48 based on my two biggest metrics coming in at 150%. 

Now this is where it gets weird. The bonus pool was only 54% funded. Like, what does that even mean and why wasnt it 94% funded based on company profits.  Was unaware of this little dirty trick when I signed up last year. Has anyone ever seen this? Why is it set up this way? Can this be changed? 

Just super depressed and a little angry about it. Seems like Jip and a way for c suite to make more. ","Salary",0,0,0,0.33,0,0,0,2
"7","https://www.reddit.com/r/Salary/comments/1bg09rh/how_should_i_negotiate_the_offer/","cocosaunt","2024-03-16",1710572513,"How should I negotiate the offer? ","I got offered a job today verbally. The base salary is significantly above what I am currently making however I realized that the initial offer is much lower than what I deserve. I want to negotiate the salary but Ive never done it before so any advice on how to go about doing it would be great. A few points for context: 
1) I lowballed myself unfortunately. This role isnt one that exists in all companies and finding information online was very difficult. I gave a range that is much lower than what I shouldve asked for and they are actually offering me a base salary that is 2k higher than the upper end of the range I gave. 
2) I know they are lowballing me because I have a friend who works at the company and I reached out to her after I got the offer to ask her what her experience was with negotiations. While I was talking to her, she pulled up the internal posting and told me the job level and that she was at the same job level as the role I applied to and the range for that job level started at a base salary 15% higher than what they offered me
3) I have another company I am currently interviewing with - its for a different but similar role that I had more context for and I also learned from my mistake and asked for a higher range to begin with. I did the first interview this week, it went really well, I fully expect to move forward to the next interview stage. I will also state here that I interview very well and have so far been offered all jobs Ive ever interviewed for
4) While the base salary they are offering is higher than what I currently make, I actually feel that I am underpaid for the work that I do. I chronically undervalued myself in the past. Also the company I work at is a much smaller one in comparison. 

I want to negotiate and Im not afraid of losing the offer because I truly think I have the experiences and skills and will bring lots of value to the role/company. 

Whats the best way to negotiate especially since I lowballed myself? Should I acknowledge that in my negotiation or simply negotiate the base salary? Any other tips/considerations? I Thanks in advance! ","Salary",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,2
