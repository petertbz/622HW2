Other posts have noted the US now has some of the highest suicide rates ever recorded, this might be part of the reason why.

 ***Photo above*** *- US government sues Apple because its iPhones are popular.*

Last time I checked, the US smartphone market was NOT a monopoly. And I just checked the full year 2023 sales statistics. Apple  50%. Samsung  22%. Lenovo 8%. Pixel  5%. Everyone else is scrambling for the remaining 15%. Keep scrambling, guys!

Don't pay any attention to the actual statistics. This is an election year. 40% of US voters self-identify as socialists or communists. Suing Apple, Google, Twitter, and Facebook is sure going to be a hit with that crowd. Hard to understand why that proposed anti Tik-Tok law is so unpopular. Maybe it's Chinese trolls going to war with us?

What's the endgame of suing Apple? Have them sell fewer phones? Make the price go down? (that's easy enough  just stop inventing new features). Require iPhones to be carbon neutral by 2050?

I'd cheer for the DOJ's ambitious Apple lawsuit, except they really aren't very good at their jobs. The DOJ has yet to deliver anything on the 2020 election interference thing. (Find me the (Georgia) votes.) That lawsuit was delegated to a second-rate local DA, and her third-rate boyfriend. How about the 11,000 classified documents? Those FBI agents with machine guns infiltrating Mar a Largo while nobody's home certainly was must see TV. But where's the lawsuit? To be fair, Biden's own unexpected cache of top-secret Docs has made the DOJ skittish. The government had a long and hugely expensive suit against Microsoft. Today, Windows is still the operating system on every PC sold in America. The US government is also suing to stop the JetBlue-Spirit airlines merger. Not because it would create a powerful monopoly, but because some mega-donors at United and American Airlines perhaps felt threatened by the proliferation of cut rate carriers.

The DOJ is an agency without a clear and concise mission statement. If I was asked to create one, that statement might include having the FBI investigate ransomware, hacking of hospitals and banks, state sponsored grid takedowns, etc.

Are there any REAL monopolies in America? Try these on for size:  


1. **Amazon** controls 89% of the retail electronics market
2. **AT&amp;T** has half of the wireless contracts in America
3. **Boeing** sells more commercial jets than all other manufacturers in the USA  combined.
4. **Google** is already being sued over its 82% search engine share. But it only has that much of the market because Bing really, really sucks. (There/s a new Bing feature - a button which says ""make Bing stop responding"". For real - check it out.)
5. **GM** sells more than half the vehicles made by US automakers. But it's a union shop, so keep that in mind . . .

To make my point clear, I am NOT suggesting that the DOJ launch a half dozen new antitrust lawsuits, just because it has a lot of lawyers and free time on its hands. This entire Apple adventure is likely to end up like Microsoft and Google  no change in market Apple's market share or product pricing. But it will cost tens of millions  perhaps of hundreds of millions  in tax dollars. And go on for years.

I'd settle for tackling actual problems. Like the Georgia election interference. The classified docs by ALL politicians who are accused. And investigating every member of congress who accepted illegal campaign contributions or bribes. But I realize that's maybe asking too much.

I'm just sayin' . . .
