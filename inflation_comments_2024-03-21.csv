According to this graph (which admittedly only covers 1998-2018), cars have lagged the CPI and hourly earnings. As others have said, there are new cars for $18,000 or less and they have significantly more technology and features meaning that cars have actually gotten cheaper relative to inflation. [Link to pic source](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/krdsww/20_years_of_price_changes_in_the_us_guide_to/?xpromo_edp=enabled)

Many cars are getting more expensive these days because consumers demand larger, more luxurious vehicles and automakers have killed off smaller cars like the one in the picture. The average transaction price is going up as a result but it's not because cars are getting more expensive to produce.

If we were to produce the car in that picture, we could probably do it for well under $18,000. In Mexico, the Fiat Mobi was launched in 2021 for under $10,000. It's a 4 door hatchback with 69 horsepower (nice) and is probably fairly comparable to this base Ford Escort in the picture which was upgraded to 86 horsepower in mid 1985.

There are many things going up significantly in price for the same level of good/service but cars aren't one of them.","148"

Just because a car has a sticker of 18 grand doesn't mean real value is there at that price.

As you mentioned, manufacturers have killed off the smaller, more affordable cars.  The Honda Fit was affordable, practical, effecient, and incredibly durable.  They don't sell it in the US anymore.  The profit isn't there.  It's better for Honda to make larger, more expensive cars.  They don't care if it isn't better for consumers.

Entry level then was what it was.  It had what was normal for the era of tech and safety, just like cars have what is normal for their era now.  Entry level now is what it is.  Nobody is going to make a car without all the modern crap that's mostly useless... it wouldn't sell.  So entry level now should be at a relative price point compared to entry level then.

Considering there are so few budget cars available now, the fact is they are vanishing, but people aren't earning vastly more to afford the more expensive options.  They *think* they can afford them, but they're financing and not paying cash.  Even with financing, pretty soon people won't be able to keep getting into cars if the prices keep rising.

Just FYI, one thing people seem to be missing is that what you pay to eat at a restaurant isn't purely food cost. You're paying for the experience of having someone else cook for you and do the cleanup etc which means you're paying for not only the cost of the food, but the labor to cook it,  to wash the dishes afterwards, to keep the lights on, the rent of the storefront, for the equipment needed to cook it (which is extremely expensive) etc etc.  With the cost of food and labor skyrocketing lately restaurants can't afford to just absorb those rising costs because our margins are already extremely thin.  The convention is if you're making 5% profit you're doing good.  The restaurant I work in has had to raise our prices over the past couple years for sure but our profit margin hasn't gone up, that's because the price of everything is increasing and we're just trying to stay alive. We're a front line industry, we don't decide the cost of these things.  That being said, I think our food is a lot better than Denny's.","17"

You want to compare Disney+ to Netflix that started like a decade earlier, giving it 10 years+ to create a solid customer base. Netflix has been around so long its even part of a term used to signify NSA sex, Netflix and Chill. Netflix also had its previous business in the film rental industry. Remember mail DVD rentals? Theyve been in the industry since 1998 and didnt become profitable until 2003. In contrast, Disney+ came out in 2019. This year would be exactly 5 years - just like Netflix - where it becomes profitable.

We have high quality digital cameras and studios worth of software for less than a fraction of what it used to cost.  If you really wanted to, just a few dudes with some good ideas could make something on par with Hercules and Xena... check out the silly indie D&amp;D films on Amazon.  


The big media companies painted themselves into a corner continually raising the bar for effects over lore.  Now nobody's impressed by once mind-bending explosions.  It's all meh.

I think the idea is that high rates are not sustainable long term for these areas, and many others.
