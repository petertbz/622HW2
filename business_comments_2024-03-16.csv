ECOM Backend - The backbone if your operation. This is important to have a well understood back-end with strong API support. It will be a nightmare as you grow if this is lacking and will cost you a shitload of money if you need to make a lot of custom integrations to make anything work. 

ECOM Frontend - what the customer sees. The User Experience of the website, makes or breaks it for many customers. Its more than a theme, this is how the customer perceives your brand. You cheap out on this, and you can literally see the frustration points from customers come in either via your support tools or via insight tools. 

Customer Data Platform (CDP) + Email Sending Platform (ESP) (best return in terms of marketing communication). Email marketing has a massive impact in your revenue that you will see every single email that goes out. That connected information also gives you a massive insight into who your customer is. The bigger this list grows the more you are going to make. improving them will also help move from a purely acquisition based strategy to a retention strategy. Mailchimp, Klaviyo are your beginner ones for pure players (Ecom only) shops. 

Order Management - how your fulfillment is handled, even if you are doing this manually, its still needs to be tracked. This is as basic as order confirmed, paid, shipped, cancelled and returned, to much more complex capabilities that allow for exchanges to reduce returns, and more. 

Payment Solution Provider (PSP) - Cant have a business without a payment provider. Your checkout the last step in the funnel and a shit experience will lose you money. Having a shitty integration with your PSP will make your life hell for accounting. 

Feed aggregator (Optional)- Needed by all the major advertising channels to enable shopping channels within their network. Some platforms can create product feeds that needed by many advanced ecom tools. Search &amp; Merch/ProductRecommendations/Shopping Feeds. Its worth it, especially one that easy to understand and transform you product data. Channable for example. 

PIM (optional) - Production Information Management, more advanced and saves you a lot of time when it comes to product data. But its a bit advanced, but very helpful when its comes to multi-lang/country/market. Akeneo and InRiver for example 

Content Management System (CMS) (optional) - With many ecom platforms like Shopify/Woo/Shopware/etc they come with a built in CMS. They are limited, but usually good enough for a while. But when you start hosting more data intensive formats you will look into having a CMS to host and transform your content. 

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) (optional) - Expensive and you need a certain scale before this is important. But its really important after a while when it comes to your supplier ordering and your own internal process. 

Warehouse Management Software (WMS) (optional) - Your pick and pack organization. You can get away with this manually for some time depending on how many SKUs you have, but after a certain scale (especially in the number of orders per day and your delivery cutoff time) you will want to improve this to gain efficiency and will allow you onboard and off-board staff easily. 

 Integration Layer (optional)- This allows you to easily transform payloads from one system to another. It makes your life easier, but their business model is usually paid in the number of calls. 

Data lake (optional)- Its going to be very difficult to completely understand all your data. Every company needs/should have analytics and that starts with storing your data. From there you can clean and transform your data and make internal dashboards of whats going on. Many platforms can do a light version of this, but once you start adding more integrations, you need to take responsibility for it. You will always need 3 elements to make this work for you. 1. Data Scientist, 2. Data Engineer, 3. Data Analyst. This usually because each one does a role and its around this 1. Understanding the data 2. Clean the Data , 3. The commercial relevance. There are a lot of tools for this on market both free and paid. All promise to solve your problems, but in the end you have to know what is important to grow your business and the data is there to inform you if the decision worked or not. 

Customer Service - If you have a B2C business, you will need support. Zendesk is popular but expensive. There a lot of good solutions on shopify that will break your bank, see gorgias. Email is bare minimum. 


 Now if you are 1 person business and you are really dont care about all this, then sure go woo or wordpress, but if you are growing. They will be a huge pain in the ass. Shopify is strong in usability and has a lot of connectors. Its easy to built with, and there are a lot of good agencies that cater to it. Its ease of use and app marketplace is the reason why its the biggest ecom platform in the world. The marketplace usually has a solution to problem you are having, because you likely not the first person to have your [insert problem], and there usually is a solution.","1"

- If price action is consolidating
- Expect it to stay where it has been rather than going to new areas
- Trade mean reversion
- Following it back and forth in the consolidation zone
- Shorting at the top, going long at the bottom
- The high probability loss would be to try and time breaks to the upside or downside

- If price action is directional
- Expect it to continue moving in that direction until proven otherwise

For most that you mentioned, Id probably go it alone - but that is just me, and because I dont know of many household names in junk removal, marketing, or mobile food service - so competitive brand recognition isnt as big of a concern. With that, generally, a franchise will train you to some extent as well as offer support. They have a vested interest in you succeeding; however, they will be taking a piece of the pie, so it can definitely impact margin. It also adds to the cost of the venture, as you still have to pay for all of the startup, but have the franchise fee attached as well. They also have a say in how you run things, which can get old - but normally have some proof of concept with a successful track record. 

Whichever you choose, in my opinion, if you show up on time, with a great attitude, an open mind, and work your butt off, I believe you can do it. Create value for the customer, and success will follow.","2"

I do not know how you got this money, but assuming you got it by working some kind of job you already know what your concrete skill set is and you already know at least one industry at least semi well from working a job in it. You should use this money to buy yourself some kind of ownership role in your own industry, whether that's starting something, buying an existing business (very likely the best option in your spot, better than a franchise by far also better than a startup), or whatever else is available.

If you inherited this money, won the lotto/crypto/whatever, my advice is to first take a year or two and go out and get a job in sales. You want to be in business that's one thing you're never going to be able to outsource entirely, and you never want to be dependent on other people for it if push comes to shove. You'll learn a ton about business, you'll make pretty decent money, you'll get paid to work out a very important muscle, and now there's at least one industry you know pretty well.

Then invest in the industry you were a salesperson in, wherever the best available opportunity is.

Or open a restaurant / get a restaurant franchise and ruin your life lol.","3"
