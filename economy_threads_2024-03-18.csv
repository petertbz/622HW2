 ***Photo above*** *- NYC temporary housing for illegal aliens. The good news - now they will be evicted after 30 days. The bad news - buses continue to bring thousands of new migrants each week.*

Let this be a lesson to voters who think the time has come for law and order politicians. Eric Adams  former cop, and current mayor of NYC - has struck out 3 times trying to solve the migrant crisis. First, he tried busing them to Canada (for real), but the Biden administration stepped in to stop that. Then Adams tried to prevent buses from Texas and Florida from docking at NYC bus terminals if they were carrying illegal aliens. The bus companies pivoted to disgorging their passengers in Fort Lee NJ with a complimentary subway ticket into NYC.

Now Mayor Adams is up to the plate again. He's announced that migrants can spend only 30 days in a city funded hotel, apartment, school gymnasium, or whatever. After that, any migrant (if an adult) will be discharged to the street on his/her own recognizance. See the link at bottom.

I'm sure that everyone, irrespective their political affiliation or bias, can anticipate what happens next. Migrants who just hit the bricks will try their luck at panhandling, drug dealing, human trafficking, carjacking, breaking and entering, shoplifting, and armed robbery. Or perhaps they migrate to Georgia and assault student nurses? I'm sorry  that was cruel and uncalled for, even it's 100% true.

New York is about to celebrate opening day of the good weather/high crime season. Native born felons, and those with green cards, who have been chillin' indoors during the winter, are about to throw out the first pitch of the 2024 summer season. Teens will also be out of school. Now migrants will be jockeying for the same streetcorners and bodega sidewalks. If you were waiting for the 3rd shoe to drop, this might be it.

I have to confess, I had higher expectations for Adams when he won the election. But other than accepting sketchy campaign funds, and appointing cronies to city offices, he's done little for the people who voted for him. I can excuse him on the Canadian bus thing. But pretending not to know what happens when criminals without prospects hit the streets is an insult to voters' intelligence.

I'm not anti-immigrant. I'm anti-criminal. There aren't enough jails in NYC to hold the LEGAL felons, let alone migrants who get arrested. That's why drug dealers, (un)armed robbers, serial shoplifters, and assaulters of subway passengers are released on their own recognizance, over and over.

This writer may not have all the answers, but there are a few obvious ones here. First of all, arrest AND DEPORT illegal aliens who have open warrants. Don't even take them to trial, since there's no room at the jail. If you're here illegally, you can be expelled. Pricier than a bus ticket to Toronto, but clearly a more immediate impact.

Second, secure the border. Only a madman could believe that there should be wildly different standards for US entry, depending on where you disembark. If you deplane at Kennedy or LaGuardia, you need legal ID, and a visa. And homeland security checks you against Interpol, and previous lists of deportees. None of that applies if you walk across at Nogales, Texas. Time for equal justice under the law. It's actually part of the US constitution, I believe. Whether the president has actually read the damn thing, or not.

I'm just sayin' . . .

https://www.marketplace.org/2023/12/12/what-immigration-actually-does-to-jobs-wages-and-more/

There seem to be two economic perspectives on immigration. One is that it boosts our economy and employment and the other is that it hurts people in our economy but might create some winners even while it creates losers. The arguments get muddied by other values and I suspect this is why there is so much intellectual dishonesty instead of simply trying to mitigate the potentially harmful effects immigration has on some populations.

Some people only want to help poor people in other countries and reunite families of immigrants by having a pro-immigration stance. Some want to maximize profits by lowering labor costs. Some believe immigration creates a better society. Some believe immigrants can make more money for their families working in the US. Some want to protect wages and employment. Some believe immigration detracts from their cultural identity. Some believe immigration increases crime. Some believe immigration grows the entire economy. Im only concerned with answering the impact of immigration on wages and employment - who it benefits and who (if anyone) it harms.
