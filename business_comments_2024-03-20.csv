Over here in my place we have several ride sharing and cab applications and to stay in the business/compete on profits every one of them chose dynamic pricing.

Then about a little more than a year ago, a new startup cab service came up, EV only cabs and no dynamic pricing. The only difficulty? Because the fleet size is small, you have to preplan your trips. Worked like a charm especially for folks who know their commute is on fixed times.

Skip to today and that new cab service has a significantly bigger presence and more cars and is a genuine challenger to Uber and others, eating into their share. And because the fleet is bigger, you can now get a cab within 20 mins.","1_1"

One of the biggest things that helps us is that if it is especially expensive we wait like 15 or 30 minutes to see if the price goes down. It absolutely works for ride share companies and the consumers and the drivers. 

While Wendy's was saying that they were going to use it to lower prices during off-peak hours, we all had no faith that at no certain point during this experiment that they were going to raise prices during peak hours. And we're all right, our backlash was justified because we can't trust these companies to not absolutely take advantage of surge pricing. It is very much give them an inch they'll take a mile. And it wouldn't just be Wendy's too. If it was successful other companies would immediately hop on. That's what company trends show over the past couple years. The prices for food and other human needs need to be regulated and kept under control because it is a necessity.

There are cost efficiencies in being able to predict demand.  Manufacturers who can accurately predict demand and scale variable costs accordingly have an immense advantage over the competition.

Highly trained surveillance drones will buzz around the office, capturing 4K footage of each employee's screen to analyze productivity metrics like words typed per minute and frequency of checking social media.

For maximum accuracy, employees will undergo hourly iris scans and random pop quizzes on their current tasks. Any discrepancies between claimed progress and quiz results will be promptly addressed by our friendly yet stern HR interrogators.

Great questions!

1- your instincts are correct, the line of credit is a dumb idea and not the correct structure for a partner buyout.Â 

2- depending on your business performance, it sounds like a SBA 7a loan would be suitable for a partner buyout. Â Check out the SBA SOP. Â Lenders use it but its a great resource for borrowers to understand the details.Â 

3- Â considering the business size, reach out to community banks and credit unions in your area, and perhaps smaller regionals. Â  Big banks, especially without a business banking and/or SBA department wont give you the time day due to the loan size. Â PRO-TIP: the more you offer to more likely you can get approved for a loan - so be willing to offer (well it will actually be required), unlimited personal guarantees and guarantees from your bar. Â Suggest your banker underwrite it as global to include the business cash flow, plus your personal income from other sources. Â 

4- DO NOT, UNDER ANY FUCKING CIRCUMSTANCES TAKE OUT A FINTECH / ONLINE LOAN!! Â Nothing kills businesses as quickly as fintech loans. Â Never. No matter what. Avoid, avoid, avoid. Its heartbreaking.Â 

5- if youre having issues getting approved for the loan size, you may need to split it up between a loan and seller carryback financing. Â That can also help cash flow.Â 

6- ask questions and read all documents. Â Bankers forget not everyone knows bank terms - and it can be confusing. Â No one will judge you or turn you down because you ask questions or need additional explanations. Â Dont just go along with any plan unless you understand it.Â

So first, by fintech I mean all those high interest rate, fast money youre approved in 48 hours!, non-regulated online-based companies. Â Its basically like a payday loan for businesses. Â 

Often people take it as a last resort when they need to cover payroll or pay unhappy vendors. Â However, sometimes otherwise healthy companies that are growing quickly or Â inexperienced with debt sign up and things go downhill quickly&

Â This is because fintech loan is paid back on a weekly or every other week schedule by auto-debiting your bank account. Â The interest rate is crazy high - like over 40% in some cases - and the principal repayment schedule is typically a year or less.Â 

Â It becomes incredibly challenging to manage cash - regardless of how profitable your business is. Â Unlike a bank, fintech lenders arent willing to work with people. Â Theyll file suit quickly if there isnt money in the account.Â 

I know there was a comment about not doing the SBA loan because of the guarantees - but to counter that - banks are 1000% more open to work with you if times get tough if you guarantee the debt. Â Going after a personal guarantors assets is often a last resort and happens when the person is not willing to work with the bank. Â  Its just a sign of good faith that youre committed to the business and willing to do what it takes to pay back the money borrowed

At $250k per 20% share, your partnership is appraising the businesss value at $1.25M. This is much higher than the businesss current market value. 

A restaurant/bar would need to show a history of producing $400k to $450k per year in Sellers Discretionary Earnings (a measure of profits) for an owner-operated business to justify this value. 

Regarding the assets, I suspect they cost you $477k. The value were looking for is the resale value, which may be 1/3 of that amount. 

With assets worth maybe $175k and a history of only slight income for the owners, the business may be worth $250k. This is the current value. 

On the other hand, the business is about to turn a corner, become profitable, and compound in value. If you can do $2.5M in sales in 2024 and again in 2025, and you maintain a 25% profit margin, the business may reach the $1.25M value you have in mind. 

A bank isnt likely to lend on the business because it isnt showing profits. 

Outside investors can be easier to persuade initially. But when the excitement cools off, they also usually come to their senses and back out. 

Seller financing or royalty payments to your partners could be a fit once the business is profitable.

You have a wealthy friend that wants to be a silent partner the question is what kind of return do they want and what you can get 5% in in a bank CD & might be a little risky, but you might get somebody who would be interested if they were able to get a seven or 8% return& but Im guessing if somebody invested $750,000 to buy your partners out, they probably want at least 10","7"

When COVID hit they cut our line from a $750,000 to $25,000 in a single day.   We didn't even find out about the reduction in available credit until contractors started demanding payment for bounced checks.  We received a letter 2 weeks later with a nice little warning that we were now ""over your available credit limit"" and the interest rate was jacked up from 8% to the default rate of 27%.   They gave us 22 days to pay off the balance or they would start adding over the limit charges to our account on a daily basis.    When Capital One eliminated their Spark Business division they closed 2 of our accounts without notice and it took them about 3 months to mail us a check for the balances of those accounts.  

The reason given was, ""changing market conditions"".  

Capital One is a scary company to work with because they are very unpredictable.  I would recommend avoiding Capital One entirely.  I even stopped using Capital One for my personal cards because it would damage my credit score if they pulled this crap with my personal cards.","1"
