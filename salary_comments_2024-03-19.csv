You are being underpaid specially if numbers are better. What you have also gave to understand is that external hires will get more than tenure employees like yourself. You may have gotten a good starting salary 2 years ago but things have progressed with inflation etc and an external candidate will alway get more. 25% is still a lot and IMO underpaid. 

1. You can talk to your manager directly and talk numbers not feelings. If you are a better employee and numbers speak to your value, you should ask for a raise and she should or if she wants, take it up and fight for you. She can also take the route that you mentioned with the upcoming merit increase but thats a long time to hold on to and what if its not what you expect. 

2. You can talk to your manager about it as mentioned above and HR. This can ruffle some feathers but if you are due for raise this would be the best route. Being an individual contributor as oppose to a team can also have good and bad outcomes. More than likely other newer hires may also make more than you.

I want to also emphasize negotiating is a big part of the process, if you were given a range and you did not negotiate up when you were hired or the max they could give you was what you took then this should be a concern that should be documents with HR.

It does make sense your coworker is paid more by maybe 10% but 25% is a lot, unless they have way more years of experience or like an advanced degree or something else. Or maybe they are just better at interviewing and kissing ass =

In a normal circumstance they really should be giving you like 2-5% for inflation and maintaining decent performance, but if they are laying people off I definitely wouldn't suggest you spend too much time on this. Mostly because in a practical sense it's probably not going to go anywhere, unless you want to use it as practice for negotiation, although even then I wouldn't suggest it because consequences are your manager and HR get annoyed at you and lay you off earlier or do other retaliation (illegal, but he said/she said). 

On the other hand, I think your biggest learning should be to not undervalue yourself and aim for a role that's paying 15% higher at the very least. Definitely never mention your current salary when interviewing. And don't give out the first number, force the recruiter to give you a range, even if broad due to leveling etc, and simply tell them that's within your range or not. If it's close to your range but a little lower, still continue the convo for practice (both interviewing and negotiating) and let them know you would love to know where you fall leveling wise and do all the discussion about salary at the end of they are open to that. And in negotiations, ask for all the info - both monetary and otherwise, bonuses (how often do they pay that out), health insurance (e.g. some employees contribute to your HSA or have better plans they pay for for you), gym membership etc. if they aren't flexible with salary, ask for a sign on bonus or other non monetary or smaller monetary perks.","2_2_1"

I spent a lot of time working with him to show him our systems so I had a good relationship with him already. So I did start with him, and I just let him know that hey, I gotta be upfront with you. I saw something that Im having a hard time unseeing. I didnt get mad or offended by it - I understand that them screwing me was a result of another employee trying to do a good job at their job, which is to manage the budget as cost effectively as possible. I dont like that the org operates the way they did with respect to pay transparency and such, but I know it wasnt personal. It helped that the info I saw was that the budget for the positions was set at where my coworkers were, so there was no argument that my pay was below budget for the position. 

I calmly explained and illustrated with real evidence that my performance was at a level above that of my peers. I told him that I respected his position as my supervisor, so I would appreciate it if he would raise this issue to HR on my behalf since at this org the pay for a given position is determined through a collaborative process between HR and management - with HR having the final sign off. Thankfully, that conversation he had with them went in my favor, but he knew I had planned to appeal with them directly myself had it gone another way. 

Obviously a lot of this depends on how things work at your org, but I think my tips are generally: be professional, be respectful, be reasonable. Do those 3 things and also have evidence to back up everything youre asking for, so that denying it couldnt be dressed up in any way other than because we said so. If they are smart business people and youre a productive employee, theyd be fools to let you walk or to give you reason to put a foot out the door.","3_1_1"

If/when you are eligible for an employer match, the employer match calculation likely includes a percentage of your contribution and a cap, and this is logic is possibly/probably applied on a per-paycheck basis. To get the maximum match over the course of a year, you need to contribute enough at every paycheck to trigger the maximum match, or you're leaving matching funds on the table.

A very basic example: 

Your employer will match a maximum of $200 per paycheck (based on % and cap)

Scenario 1: You contribute enough in each of 26 pay periods to get that $200 match, the match is $5200 for the year.

Scenario 2: You frontload and max your contribution after 10 pay periods.  You get $200 match on each of those, but miss out on the remaining 16 pay periods.   Total match = $2000.","1"

As of my last update in April 2023, the contribution limits for 401(k) plans, including both traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (post-tax) contributions, are set by the IRS and can change annually to account for inflation.

For the year 2023, the contribution limit for employees participating in 401(k) plans was $22,500. Additionally, for those aged 50 and older, the IRS allowed a catch-up contribution of $7,500, making the total contribution limit $30,000 for individuals in that age group.

Its important to note that the limit applies to the total amount you can contribute to both your pre-tax and Roth 401(k) accounts combined.

Why not take some $$ out of the 401k for first-time home buyer program or take some money out of the brokerage to lessen the mortgage?

In short, yes, I believe it is bad. I make 20k less than you, without kids, and have a SO that makes 80k. I don't think we would go through with a 500k house purchase without more cash savings. 


You have 134k in cash that you will use as down payment (going to buy 510k home on 400k mortgage, so you plan to use all for the house). You also made a post about making 30k in purchases for the new house. What about the closing cost? That will be an additional 10+k. Then you'll be left with zero cash!!! Nothing. With two dependents. I strongly suggest reevaluating your expectations on this one. 


How accessible are your ESPP and RSU at this very moment? 


You have over a month until closing, I would try to live on $2000 for the next month to see how realistic this will be. 


Majority of FIRE people suggest traditional 401k. Look it up. 


Don't take a 401k loans. If you sell your brokerage, then remember to save for tax. 


Having a 400k mortgage is not a huge problem, but having it with two dependents, on 140k salary, with ZERO cash savings after the purchase will make you house poor.

But to me, it is mainly a mentality thing. I can buy something on a credit card and have 12+ months of 0% apr, but I will still pay it off that month because I don't want to start or open to gate to potentially developing any bad habit.

If it is a new build, then at least you'll be cover from huge repairs for the first year ish. Maybe cut down on the 30k purchases and just slowly add new appliances every so months. 


I don't normally add bonuses or RSUs into my NW unless it is access in cash. It's just a very conservative mindset of mine. Especially if you get lay off or want to switch jobs, then you may not get those $$. 


It's not the end of the world to cut back in retirement saving short time to rebuild the cash reserve. Just know that you are responsible for two dependents and two retirements (yours and your SO). 


If you haven't already, get a term life insurance policy just in case something happens to you. Especially because you'll have just enough NW to cover for the mortgage and college for one kid. ","4_2_1"
