First time writing on here. I need some advise. Right now I work as an assistant manager in purchasing working **hourly**, 40 hours a week for $22. My boss wants to promote me to manager of the department working **salary** he said starting off $50,000/ yr. but working a nine hour shift (45 hours a week). I did the math for this and thought that my boss is depreciating my hourly rate, essentially. 

40 hr, $22.00 hr = $45,760/ yr salary

45 hr, $21.37 hr = $50,000/ yr salary

I asked if staying on the clock was an option and he said no. I also inquired if i could work a 40 hr, $24.04 hr = $50,000/ yr salary. But he said all his managers work a nine hour shift.

Is it worth taking the position if the pay just doesn't make sense?
