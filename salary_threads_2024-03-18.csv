Im 32 so still have quite a few years left, but ultimately I sometimes feel like Im thinking too much about 30+ years down the road.

At the end of Q3, 2023, I had my performance review and salary review. After it was pushed a month due to management hold-ups, I was told I would be the only one receiving a raise and bonus in my department due to exceptional performance. They were deferring all salary reviews for 6 months. I am not afraid to say I am a top performer and have the stats to back it up. The increase and bonus was slightly disappointing and far less than Id hoped. I am not an ungrateful person, and did not feel right about pursuing any further salary negotiation based on the knowledge, from a manager, that none of my colleagues were receiving a bonus or raise.

Fast-forward to one month ago and at a work function, from no action of my own, I find out two of my colleagues received a near identical increase and bonus. My issue is not what others earn, its that I was blatantly lied to.

My question is this: should I call out my manager when I have my upcoming review? If so, what is the best or most appropriate manner? This issue, amongst others, has made me call into question my place at the company.

Thank you.

 And I am thinking about moving to a new workplace. Longer transit (10mins longer commute)but better boss, and better benefits.

Current salary is usd 6300/month.
And I have no clue what to ask for in my coming talk..

I have the luxury of being able to move clients worth alot to a bottom line (I think?). But I don't know the actual worth of something like this..

Example 1. Client A follows me. Will be active At least for 10 years and will yield 300.000 USD in profits per year.

Work is very easy, so I have 90% of my workday for other tasks also.. so in my eyes I bring alot of value to a company, and with leftover time to also handle other tasks / clients.


All suggestions to be considered.. my own idea is asking for 7000-7300 usd /month.

Let me know what the professionals think.

Is mine too low?","Recently, Ive started to be concerned that my take-home pay is lower than it should be. Whenever I use an online salary calculator or see online threads of people with similar or lower salaries, it seems they are netting more! 

I live in Pennsylvania  I contribute to a 401k ( not enough admittedly ) and pay for health / disability insurances. 

My company contributes $0.75 for every eligible $1.00 I contribute for the first 6% of total pay (maximum match is 4.5% of total pay). 

I get paid bi- weekly.

Biweekly break down:

Gross : 5,509.74 (80hrs)
Taxes ( 1,438.07) - what in the actual fuck. How is this normal and then I still owe money at the end of each year 
Benefits (64.75)
Retirement (550.97)
Other - Disability insurance (7.51)

Bi weekly Take home: $3,448.44


The amount of taxes that gets taken out makes me ill and I feel like  it has to be incorrect.

$1438.07 Tax breakdown 

Federal $793.78
Social Security $337.82
Medicare &amp;79.00
Pa state $167.16
Local income and SVC tax $56.45
SUI tax $3.86


Please share your salaries and tax breakdowns, especially if you live in PA but information from other would be insightful as well.


TLDR: im a fucking idiot who knows the pythagorean theorm but nothing about being a real adult. Please share your salaries and take home pay with me for reference so I can figure out if what I am receiving biweekly is normal because it seems too low. ","Salary",0,0,0,0.45,0,0,0,20
