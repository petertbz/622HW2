Ipod 2 years prior was a Zune mp3 player.  IIRC apple had to pay Microsoft a ton because it was patented.  Even the dial was patented by MS. 

Smart phone was windows CE that was used for pda palm pilot type, still used for many handheld barcode scanners and cable boxes and stuff. Even had a windows phone that was far superior to any device. 

Xbox was first local then online gaming system. 

First foldable was a surface duo.  Horrible performance but 1st.

Neither is very cutting edge, which is understandable for companies of that scale.

AI has been around in various forms since the 60s.

Apple and others take Microsofts ideas and then make it look cool.    Apple hasn't created a single feature that didn't exist.  They stole Zune media player and made an ipod, used that to make a larger screen called iPad and it's been the same for 10+ years.  They even stole the pencil from Microsofts surface pro. 

Macbooks have zero special features.

I agree, that an Authors message can add to what is an artistic piece. But that isn't the definition of Art, a Landscape Painting doesn't have a message, it is just a representation of a place, in a certain medium, and that looks nice and that possibly means something to someone because of their history with that place.

Talking about soul is just moronic, these are inert objects, in fact soul doesn't exist in non-inert objects. It is just made up. Meaning to an individual can of course exist.

Why is the Mona Lisa one of the most valuable paintings in the world, when an AI could surely do better?

If we were only comparing at a superficial level an AI generated piece of art vs. a human made artwork then I'd agree with you, that a lot of times you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. 

What we consider though to be a unique or novel creation stems from the scarcity of a human's ability to create something with those qualities and from the connection between the human creator, the consumer, and the object itself. AI is unlimited in its ability, and so it's artistic creations will never be valued as a scarce resource. And AI is not human, so its creations will never have a story that connects authentically to our culture or being as humans.

The conclusion is that this ""fully AI-generated game"" that Nvidia's CEO speaks of will be competing against a million other AI-generated games and we won't truly value any of them.

It favours small developers possibly more than large ones. The creativity and translating that into a system that AI can understand and model for you becomes the value. 

If the AI model is just 50 models that represent the physics of the real world with parameters to modify those physics, now build, you can do anything there. The question is how fluidly you can add new truly novel mechanisms like seen in Zelda or Portal.

The article is actually talking about AI to replace current methods of 3D rendering to produce the graphics of a game.  

&gt; were not really talking about a reality where you can ask an AI to make me a first-person shooter themed around folk dancing or something  although that could happen eventually (itd be called Machinegun Morris Dancers incidentally)  but more like a framework in which an AI can generate the world, models and textures, on-the-fly.

It's an interesting idea.  Generating HD, realistic graphics takes a lot of processing power.  It drives (or justifies) new, expensive consoles and gaming PCs.  

However, whether AI really can generate 3D environments that largely or totally eliminates the need for standard graphics processing, whether they will be reliable enough, and whether it can do so with *less* processing power are big questions.  Future products may be ""AI"" but fail one or all of these goals:

1. The game still has a traditional graphics engine, with AI just as another layer to it.
2. AI creates new glitches in the visuals (doors with no handles, etc.)
3. AI doubles the processing power, requiring even more expensive consoles to games ""powered by AI"" that look visually the same as the past 2 generations of console.","3"

People need to understand the rise of AI in the workforce is nothing new, we've been here before it's just in different sectors and different capabilities now. Most of you have no problem with the bland, mass produced furniture that Ikea makes. Every now and then you'll buy something bespoke and hand crafted and you'll love that more than any of your mass produced Ikea furniture. Sure you may marvel every now and then at how clever some of the Ikea stuff can be but lets be honest, all the hand crafted stuff just hits the heart differently for you, you cherish it a bit deeper, you wish deep down all your stuff could be like that but it's just so damn expensive that you could never afford to deck your whole house out in handmade beautiful works.

Gaming, movies, art, everything really is going towards this *Ikeaficitation* of the economy with AI. They'll be smart, they'll be cheap as all hell to buy, and everyone will see it as the sort of obvious first point of purchase. They won't feel like they've got a voice though, they won't feel like they carry a unique perspective, they won't feel like they bring as much uniqueness to the table as the handcrafted things and that's fine. We'll save our dollareedoo's for a few entertainment purchases a year that will feel really special and unique and we'll cherish them just that much more.

There's a counterculture to everything in the world and at the peak of mass production it's no surprise we see the economy itself split into a mainstream economy driven by mass genericization (the Ikeafication) and a counterculture economy (bespoke craftsman).","8"

Already, the company has started catering to high-earning customers. Yolanda Jones, a 48-year-old from St. Louis, Missouri, told the news outlet that she thought she hit the jackpot when she stumbled upon duck breast in her local Walmart. 

In Secaucus, New Jersey, consumers can find jars of red sauce from Carbone and top-of-the-line beauty products from Skingym and Mario Badescu. In terms of apparel, the stores have added labels including Reebok and US Polo Association.

Jordan Berke, a former Walmart executive, told Bloomberg that the retail giant has a history of studying consumer behavior to better grasp what luxury shoppers actually wantand the effort is clearly paying off. 

According to data from Placer.ai, households earning between $100,000 to $150,000 a year flocked to the retailer last year and were the second-biggest group of Walmart shoppers in 2023, which is largely a result of inflation.

Walmart hired Denise Incandela as executive vice president of fashion and private brands. Incandela, whos previously worked for Ralph Lauren Corp. and Saks Fifth Avenue Inc., is hoping to find success with a younger generation of higher-income consumers by stocking stores with trendy blouses and jumpsuits. Gen Z shoppers are leading the luxury market, after all.","1"

Accessory buildings where I am are for agriculture uses, or ancillary things, like a shed or workshop only.

Many communities are updating ordinances to allow Accessory Dwelling Units (many of which have their own significant zoning requirements) but still do not allow business use at all.  If you're located in a HOA, it may be more difficult yet.
