Ive talked to my peer many times about how we should be assistant directors rather than managers. 

The compounding issue is when I came into the department, it was early Covid and I didnt have the on-paper experience. So that underpaid status has haunted me. My boss knows this and basically handed me my current role to retain me as I was looking for other positions. 

For sure a multifaceted issue and I can be somewhat patient as I love my job. Reviews are in the summer and pay changes are around December. I can wait until then, but I will for sure start looking if I dont get to at least mid-range market standard. 

Will edit post to add: I make $80k // market standard  range is $80-$120k based on my initial searches.","1_1_2_1"

Some companies have lower retention budgets than new hire budgets. It could be the case that you want to continue at your current company, then still get an offer and ask them to match, Netflix does that, actually recommends. But some companies may not like that you are shopping around, if that is the case, you would walk away. W2 job is renting your time/skills for money, nothing emotional.","3"

I don't think a masters in marketing is going to teach you much that you couldn't learn on your own with youtube. Your professor probably isn't going to be that good at marketing...If you took the money you'd spend on the masters and invested into your agency / learning from other successful people, you'd probably be in better shape. 

It also depends on what you want out of life. Do you want to stick in a CS career path or do you want to pursue your own business / agency? Do you want the safety of being an employee or the freedom of being an entreprenuer? The chances of success are much lower with the agency but the income ceiling is much higher.  


You could take your existing CS experience and start freelancing on upwork / other sites. You could easily get $50-100/hr doing that. Starting an agency is a ton of work, if you want that out of life I would consider that as an option.   


I don't think you should fully quit your job, having an income is critical to staying afloat in the meantime. You should be able to manage both. It will suck but is possible.","1_1"
