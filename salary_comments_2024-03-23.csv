They take stock options, bonuses, etc. This excludes pure investment people like real estate or Warren Buffet types since they aren't exactly salary. 

Your best bet to consistently make 4 million a year is to develop an application or software that has good penetration into the market. Tech has created more millionaires with less work than any other industry. That's not to say it's no work, or easy, and it's as much luck as skill. The other option is investment or finance at the corporate level, but of the thousands of people in those jobs very few will make big money. Most people have a few big earning years. 

Compensation is directly tied to your contribution to the GDP. Barring fraud, which is plentiful and illegal, most big earners produce a tremendous amount of value through building, engineering, production or management of industries that do that. If there were an easy way to make 4 million dollars a year then that would just be the way. Why would anyone do anything else. Unless you come from extreme wealth there is no short cut outside of playing the game.","5"

IF you are talented enough to write a compelling, marketable story and

IF you are good enough to craft a query letter that is competent and interesting and

IF you manage to locate an agent who is able and has the connections to shop your work and

IF your story is picked up by a large publishing company and

IF your book is relevant, timely and marketed with a huge budget and 

IF you are photogenic, not a racist, homophobe or other deplorable and 

IF you hang in there for a little while, maybe a year or so and 

IF you sell ten million copies...

You can probably expect about $4,000,000 USD.

THEN - you can go on and become a successful real estate investor, actor and maybe even the governor of a United State.

But, you won't be able to run for President.","7"
