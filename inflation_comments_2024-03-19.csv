My mom and her husband had to move back here and they live with his mom now 2 houses down frim their old house .  My mom kicks herself every day about losing the house, but they never mention that maybe if they would have rented it to me, instead they'd still have it.

&gt; Is there any hope that these prices will go back down to pre-Covid levels? 

No. The prices for these items will remain due to:

* Reductions in the car lineup to focus efforts on cars and trucks that drive revenue.

* Adding value to high revenue vehicles creating more excuses for you to buy an expensive ass POS that should cost ~$15K.

* And people were willing to pay $70K for a truck. I just dont know what to say here.

**Remember every human that touches that car or truck before you buy it, makes it more expensive! That includes the Executive Team.**","1_2"

The point is that trucks currently are scammed out with useless options many people do not need for the intended use of the truck; whether that be towing, running a small business, or simply using the truck to maintain your small house or do chores. The options are used to increase profit margins because they are cheap to add and up charge for. You cannot fit a 4x8 sheet of plywood in a ranger, or many other things. To actually accomplish personal projects or do household projects which improve a property you do actually need the convenience time wise of owning a truck to get the job finished, there is really no way around it.

My co-worker has a big ass truck, $650 a month car payment, and his car insurance is like $300 a month because, of course, he has 3 DUIs.  I've seen his house, and it is a shithole.

Up until the Baby Boomers, every generation left something behind: houses, businesses, money, but not Boomers, no they'll even sell the house that they got from their parents so they can spoil themselves even more.

It essentially combines the significance of the stocks movements when a report is released, with the correlation it has with cool &amp; hot inflation

The math behind it:

For each inflation report released since Jan of 2022, I recorded if the reported inflation was above or below the consensus. Then, I calculated the returns of the stock on those days that the inflation reports were published. I then converted the percent returns to movements measured in standard deviations. Then, I compiled the average movements in STD DEVS for the times when reported inflation was -0.3 , -0.2 , -0.1, 0.1 , 0.2, and 0.3 percentage points below/above the consensus. Then, I measured the ***Reactivity*** taking the average of all the movements when inflation was below/above the consensus. This is how much (in standard deviations) a stock will move on average when inflation is below/ above the consensus. Then, I found the correlation (R\^2) that the movements had with the degree to which the inflation was above/below. In theory, a stock with complete influence from inflation should have a perfect linear relation (Losing more when inflation is hot, gaining more when inflation is cool, or perfectly vice versa). By then multiplying the R\^2 by the ***Reactivity***, the ***Influence*** is found. This metric essentially means the degree to which this stock will react to an above/below consensus inflation report in a linear and predictable manner.
