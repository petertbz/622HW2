There is value in gaining manager title and then seeing if you qualify for higher paying roles elsewhere. You could ask for more pay, giving the reasoning you lay out in this post. If you feel slighted, find another manager role elsewhere. Are there any other benefits that come with your promotion? For instance you may not be considering PTO. If you get a week of PTO thats $880 that you would not get paid if you remained hourly.","1"

In the past last year, he mentioned an extra week of pto but when we had the discussion again last week it was not brought up. Mind you, i work for a small company in Hawaii and the owner is an older gentleman. We have another meeting next week to have this discussion again. It's frustrating to explain my position because i dont think he even did the math himself.

He said the 5 extra hours a week will be my OT pay $33/ hr

So if he is saying $33/hr OT \* 5 (extra hours per week) = $165/week

$165 \* 52 weeks = $8,580

$8,580 + 45,760 (my current salary) = $54,340 i should be making, not $50,000 and that's just working one extra hour a day, not even incorporation time that may be spent over 9 hours a day.

I don't know i'm still looking at the small jump moving hourly to salary and it just doesnt make sense financially to take on the extra work and less pay.

Another side thing i find weird about this company, we have to clock out a whole hour for lunch so technically even though i work 8 hours on the clock, im here currently nine hours a day already. Where if i take this new position i will be here 10 hours a day, really 50 hours a week!","1_1"
"3","https://www.reddit.com/r/Salary/comments/1bj0arr/salary_vs_hourly/","NikeChecks2","2024-03-20",1710897910,4,4,0,0,"I think you are misunderstanding how salary works. You dont clock in or out, and if you do its simply to track attendance. You get paid for 40 hours with salary regardless if you are there or not. You dont receive OT with salary either. If you work 30 hours, you get paid for 40. If you work 45 hours, you get paid for 40. So those extra 5 hours that hes talking about OT is not a real thing. You dont receive OT and just get paid for 40 hours, although you are working 45. Now, for lunch, you wouldnt clock out for lunch like you would for hourly. You just take your lunch. So really, you would still just work 9 hour days, assuming 8 working hours plus the 1 hour of lunch. 

Thats the downside of salary. Many people get taken advantage of and work 50/55/60 hours a week, while only being paid for 40 hours. Upside is if you work less hours, you still get paid for 40, but that doesnt sound like it would be your situation. *Usually* salary employees do get better benefits such as increased PTO, bonuses, insurance, 401k match, etc. but that varies from company to company &amp; is a personal decision to decide if that is worth taking the position. If you do receive more on the benefits side, you may see less per check from a base pay standpoint - but making more on the benefits side. Another benefit as someone mentioned, is the title of manager, and being able to add that to your resume to make a lateral movement to another company with potentially higher pay. 

EDIT - Ahh I see what you mean by the OT. Hes saying your salary pay is based on what you would make if you were hourly with OT working 45 hours. Which you are correct with your math, 50k would not equal those OT hours and pay.","1_1_1"

I understand no matter how many hours you work on a fixed salary, that is what you'll get. But i guess im looking at it in a perspective of moving from hourly to salary and how my base pay will change.. But this company does not have bonuses, no 401k, i dont have their medical insurance (husband is military), i could potentially get pto 1 week if i inquire again (and i do not have any pto until i hit my 1 year Sept 2024).","1_1_1_1"

If it were me - without any added bonuses besides a measly extra week of PTO, its not worth the pay cut doing salary at 50k a year. You arent making that up in bonuses/benefits, you cant get OT to increase monthly revenue, and I can almost guarantee you will be asked to work more than 45 hours MULTIPLE times. Many times throughout a year of working there. You have more responsibilities as a manager, and you would be expected to stay longer. Unfortunate, but thats the reality. So if you work 50 hours a week, youre making less than that $21.xx you mentioned at 45 hours a week making 50k. Even more of a pay cut, with more responsibilities though. The resume factor wouldnt outweigh that for me - but again - that is a personal decision you need to make. Sacrifice money now (and maybe some sanity and stress) for a resume adder that *may* lead to a better opportunity. You have to factor in future goals, such as if you want to pursue a career in purchasing further, among other things only you would be able to determine. 

My best advice is to try and show him the numbers and let him know you would actually be taking a hit with the raise, and hopefully get a salary increase of the position that would be more to your liking. I wish you the best.","1_1_1_1_1"

I currently work hourly, im actually here 9 hours but we have to clock out for lunch 1 hour, making it a long 8 hour shift.

So if i take on the new role, technically a 10 hour day, clock out 1 hour for lunch but working 9 hours. I hope that makes sense. But in general being at work for THAT long is insane to me. 

I normally go to my appointments and make up the time throughout the week. Which this doesnt bother me. I'm never late for work or miss days. I started in Sept 2023.

Im not opposed to salaries per se, and understand the reason why companies offer them, but always surprised when employees think that its better than being hourly

They are some jobs where it works out better or some weeks you might put in 60 hours but on slow weeks you can take a Friday off& but for a salary to truly be worth it in your case, you would want to be at least 55 or 56,000","6"

Obviously, I didn't work 38.75 hours a week. Started off at 45, which quickly grew to 60, which led to 75, which eventually peaked at 80 hours a week from time to time.

As you might imagine, I was burning out like crazy, frustrated that I wasn't getting the support I needed, and pissed at my direct boss for regularly showing up to work late and leaving early because she was able to flex that she was on salary because she was able to get people like me to pick up for all her slack.

I went to my boss and my boss' boss and let them know that I was feeling taken advantage of and that I needed an increase to make up for all of the extra work they had me doing. They told me to put a business case together to prove my point.

I did, and one of my many arguments was that, based on the number of hours I was working, I was effectively being paid \~19 or 20 per hour.

They laughed at me, told me that wasn't how being on salary worked, and that it was my duty to work as much as I needed to support the business. They gave me a 3% raise -- during my annual review period which was just a few weeks later -- and that was that.

I quit and I decided I would never allow a business to take advantage of me again. Not that they won't try... that is the nature of business, but that I won't allow it to happen to me again; and I never have. Switched companies, careers, and now work in a way that puts people first, sustainability at the forefront of mind, and am paid fairly for my time.

With respect to your question, the promotion will look great on your resume, the extra opportunity and responsibility of being in management will grow your skill set. However, you must suspect that you will be taken advantage of when you switch to salary. The 45 hours will likely grow into more and more and more. The better you are at your job they more they will ask/expect/demand of you. Go back to them and ask for 55k or 60k. Bake in what you will need based on what you expect will happen over time.","12"

The career ladder for hourly work is a short ladder. There is a shorter ceiling and that is the reality.
