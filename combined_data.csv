Inflation came from

* COVID affecting supply chains.
* War in Ukraine affecting supply chains (gas and wheat).
* Lots of stimulus during the pandemic (Trump and Biden).
* $2 Billion in tax cuts (Trump).


So, how can the inflation be Biden's fault? Your account says ""1991"" so I assume you're 32/33. You really need to have a more mature view of politics if you feel so strongly.

The Fed has its policy and it will QE where it feels like it needs to, but that's not a democrat or a Republican thing. I'm not sure exactly why you'd blame an elected official for QE.

Also, we QE because rates were at 0%. Rates are no longer at 0% so QE will likely reduce and will not be the primary monetary policy lever in the next recession.

Not sure what you mean by Qe being paid back, the feds balance sheet has only dropped 1.5trilllion after hitting a record high of 9 trillion in 2021 which started in 2010. On top of that they have drained 2 trillion from the reverse repo balance over the last year which has all ended up in the economy one way or another.

&gt;But there are six stragglers: banks that still, after a decade, have neither gone under nor paid the money back. The largest of those is OneUnited Bank, which received $12 million way back in 2008

So 6 institutions haven't paid back the government for 2008. The largest borrowed $12 million. $12m is literally chump change compared to largest institutions like AIG or GM. So the truth here is somewhere in the middle. We haven't paid back 100% of the QE (you're correct) we've only paid back 99%.

Also, QE is structured as a loan so how can you say no one thinks it will get paid back? Unless the companies default then they'll pay it back. Can you provide some sources to back up the idea that the QE money is free and never gets paid back? I'm really not sure I see where you're getting that argument from and I'd love to understand a little bit better.","1_4_2_1_1_1_1","N"

&gt; What Is Quantitative Easing (QE)?

&gt;When a central bank decides to use QE, it makes large-scale purchases of financial assets, like government and corporate bonds and even stocks. This relatively simple decision triggers powerful outcomes: The amount of money circulating in an economy increases, which helps lower longer-term interest rates. This lowers the cost of borrowing, which spurs economic growth.

The fed unleashed 9t of QE since 2010.

You can google QE and theres plenty of articles detailing the feds actions regarding its balance sheet etc.

In my opinion, we are spending less than 1% of the total national budget to cripple our greatest enemy. Russia/USSR was our primary geopolitical rival. They are explicitly anti America. They interfere with elections, they foment unrest abroad, they are one of the 3 explicitly Anti West countries (with China and Iran). Turning our backs and ignoring Russia while they commit the biggest mistake and largest aggression in a generation is not a good strategy. The best strategy IMO is to spend a measly 1% of our budget to destroy them.

Housing affordability is a combination of prices and rates. Rates were near 20% in the 80s, but people were still able to afford homes because prices weren't out of control. You could save interest-bearing money for a downpayment and still afford a home.

Americans need a net income increase of at least $12,000 per year just to maintain the same standard of living they had in January 2021.

[The typical American household must spend an additional $11,434 annually just to maintain the same standard of living they enjoyed in January of 2021, right before inflation soared to 40-year highs, according to a recent analysis of government data.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-more-spend-maintain-100020606.html)

All the basic essentials needed to survive cost significantly more than they did 3 or 4 years ago - food, shelter, utilities, transportation, fuel, etc.

Inflation is a hidden tax that hurts people who have the least the most.

The dollar has been devalued and lost purchasing power.

Combine inflation with high interest rates, and homeownership or even buying a car has become out of reach for millions of hardworking people.

But the rich keep getting richer - people who already own their properties and who have fat bank accounts are benefiting from inflation and high interest rates - they are seeing their assets increase in value and their savings grow.

The wealth gap keeps getting wider.

Pretty much every study I've seen shows millennials in the worst situation over the past 25 years, but then also makes a special curiously hyper-specific footnote that it's much worse than that for those born between 81 and 83.

It's like the stars for them aligned perfectly, but the stars were: 

* Columbine and 9/11 when they are in emotionally vulnerable life stages that define mental health forever. Old enough to understand, but too young to cope with it.
* Entering college when costs are soaring but loan interest rates and availability of low income aid are terrible pre-Obama. 
* Probably loses a sibling or friend to the war in Afghanistan while being pushed to the edge by character building severe college workload.
* Unpaid internship trend kicks in just as they graduate college
* 2008 financial crisis when they were supposed to exit their ""pay your dues"" period and start making decent money.
* Startup company gig work exploitation when they should have started getting raises or converting to larger salaries with benefits.
* COVID shutdown when they would have started to make good money on well established careers.
* Post-COVID Greedflation, particularly on the bare necessities, which for many is the vast majority of their budget. 

That's without even going into the many non-event-based overall wealth transfer to the top issues that have brutally held down all pre-retirement-age generations.

And we couldn't even agree on shaving $10K off the balance of student loans they will never have enough money to repay anyway.

And yeah, while America had poignantly dark milestones, most of these things affected the global economy. One thing I will say though, is that American salaries are misleading.

Which is partly why it's so strange that we consider you millennial at all. For many, many years they didn't have a settled upon name so people didn't call them anything, or just said ""Gen Y"". Then as adults they heard about millennials, and knew what that was, but were retroactively informed that they too were millennials, not Gen Y, despite fitting almost none of the millennial characteristics written about.

I've also heard it referred to as the ""Wait Generation"" because they waited to get jobs, to mature into adulthood, to go to college in many cases, to move out of the house, to buy their first cars, to start careers, to get married, to take promotions, and to have kids.

If someone dies with debt that debt is erased. It's not paid back by the government. 

In 2008 we bailed out banks (not CC companies) and those banks actually paid back those bailouts with interest. So you might be worried about something that won't actually end up as a problem.","5_4_1","I"

The largest creditors in the US? I'm going to just Google this because it's something we can easily prove. The largest creditors of US debt is China and Japan. Domestically the largest creditors are large banks, pensions, etc. I don't really follow how that is relevant though, can you walk me through why that's related to the original argument? Seems kind of... Like you're just grasping at straws and throwing arguments to see what sticks. 

&gt;And finally, there is not a world where struggling credit card companies will not be bailed out through the Federal Reserve printing money to keep them afloat

It depends on how it goes down. If enough large financial institutions are going to collapse and it poses a systemic risk to the entire economy then they get bailed out. They get a loan and that loan gets paid back. If a single bank or CC company fails it's unlikely they can bailed out (unless they post a systemic risk) and I'm not sure e.g. Visa poses a systemic risk.","5_4_1_1_1","I"

in reality most of the people who own rental properties would file bankruptcy and have their properties actioned off due to them not wanting to let it go and providing tax breaks for smaller properties would help cut costs of building and owning property if they were to also de regulate and loosen zoning laws it would help drive down the cost of ownership but forcing most all rental properties that are STRICTLY rental not duplexes where the property owner lives there and similar situations it would flood the market with cheap homes driving down the cost dramatically","2_1_3_1_1","I"

Probably the biggest impact would be from eliminating the separate tax rates on capital gains vs income. If they were taxed at the same rate, it would get rid of an entire industry of tax lawyers and advisors funding ways to transform income into cap gains. Meet somewhere in the middle, maybe 30% would be the top rate. People who make most or all of their money from wages would get a tax cut, and private equity/hedge fund carried interest would be taxed a bit higher than currently.

The other thing is eliminating the basis step-up at death. Generational wealth is largely un-taxed currently since the basis resets to the current market value at the time of death. There could be decades of unrealized gains that become untaxable after death. There could be a carve out with a reasonable cap so that middle class families can pass a house or modest inheritance to heirs with the stepped up basis, but massive real estate empires and billionaire's assets would retain the initial cost basis.","35","I"

I don't think Trump supporters care if Trump's interests align with the Nation. Rather they care most about Trump's interests aligning against people they dislike. It is the ole saying 'enemy of my enemy is my friend'. 

American life has actually been real good over the last 40yrs. Few voters (only about 60% of eligible people vote) have experienced true hardship in their lives. Folks don't think who they elect matters on a massive scale and take for granted everything in society will mostly be the same. As such they vote to thumb their noses at others. 

Trump supporters like the idea that Trump causes mental hardship to liberals. Pronouns, plastic bags, and solar panels are things Trump supporters enjoy antagonizing others about. It's fun. Likewise the plight of single moms, over policed demographics, and exploited immigrant workers are matters they suspect are all just made up. Trump supporters think it's all a lie and are angry about it. Even if something simple could be done to help that would cost nothing they still wouldn't do it. 

The point of Trump isn't to improve anything national. Trump is a physical manifestation of annoyance and division.","1_2","I"

Hitler was a dictator and he didn't come from a 2 party Hitler, therefore 2 party systems cannot lead to dictatorships.

The problem with the argument applied to this case is that a Trump-like populist strongman has not been a figure in American presidencies since perhaps Andrew Jackson. So the 2-party system does not regularly produce people like Trump as president. When you try to explain why now and not all the other times, you need to appeal to other factors.

Fascism is a phenomenon of captialism  


Unregulated captialism will ALWAYS devolve into fascism. 


The 2 party system is just the vehicle for the rise of American captialsim, and therefore American fascism.


I do actually believe that the destruction of the 2 party system would help regulate the captialst system, and therefore could be used to stave off American fascism....


But it's a little too late for that now. 


When you compare the rise of Trump to the rise of Hitler, all of the similarities are terrifying....and those similarities have only gotten worse over the last 4 years.


And despite having different electoral systems, the factions both within and outside of those systems have aligned identically. 


The ""liberal"" party has veered right in response to the rise of the far right, and now functions as a traditionally conservative party, desperately trying to maintain the status quo.


The conservative party has begin purging non-party loyalists, as the fascists seize complete control of the establishment structure 


Subsequently, the working classes no longer see a difference between the two parties, and are choosing the more radical party out of a need for radical change


Lefitsts, seeing these blunders, is turning on the ""liberal"" party, finding strange bedfellows with the far right, both politically and ideologically  


Like, yeah we have fewer ""parties,"" but the ideological factions are practically identical.


...it's not all doom and gloom, there are a few absolute differences  


Trump and his factions aren't nearly as intelligent or ideological as the Hitler/Nazis.


They are all just in it for themselves, they don't really have greater ideals like ""German nationalism.""


The Nazis were true believers, and the American far right absolutely isn't (even though their voters are).


Also, Trump is much older than Hitler...in fact, his whole crew is much older than the Nazis were. Trump, Bannon, Roger Stone. Etc. Are all easily 10-20 years older than their Nazi counterparts. 


And, of course, the biggest difference: the economy. 


For how bad the American economy is right now, it's booming compared to the Great Depression. 


I don't know if people are necessarily desperate enough to support such radicalized, far-right figures. ","1_5_1_3","I"

Democrats would probably like to attribute a large portion of the [GDP] growth gap to better fiscal (and perhaps monetary) policies, but the data do not support such a claim. If anything, and we would not make much of such small differences, both fiscal and monetary policy actions seem to be a bit more pro-growth when a Republican is president.

The US economy has performed better when the president of the United States is a Democrat rather than a Republican, almost regardless of how one measures performance. For many measures, including real GDP growth (our focus), the performance gap is large and significant. This paper asks why. The answer is not found in technical time series matters nor in systematically more expansionary monetary or fiscal policy under Democrats. Rather, it appears that the Democratic edge stems mainly from more benign oil shocks, superior total factor productivity (TFP) performance, a more favorable international environment, and perhaps more optimistic consumer expectations about the near-term future","27_2_1_1_1_1","I"

Four years ago this week, the first wave of what would grow to be 20 million job losses set in, although most Americans were more terrified of catching a new, very transmissible, and sometimes fatal, virus. Toilet paper was nowhere to be found, but at least it was cheaper than it is now, along with most groceries.

In the months to follow, the pandemic recession was largely recognized by global and political leaders as a severe economic trauma. And the swift and almost miraculous recovery of the U.S. economy has been the [envy of the world](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/28/global-economy-gdp-inflation/?itid=lk_inline_manual_3).

It is particularly detrimental to an economy because it combines the challenges of recession and inflation, making traditional **monetary policy tools less effective.**

 While inflation usually occurs in a growing economy, stagflation's unique combination forces policymakers into a dilemma: raising interest rates to combat inflation can further suppress economic growth and increase unemployment, while lowering rates to boost the economy can exacerbate inflation. This complex scenario creates a **no-win situation** for central banks, complicating efforts to stabilize the economy and adversely affecting both consumer confidence and business investment.

Signs that the U.S. economy is flipping from goldilocks to stagflation have multiplied recently, according to Michael Hartnett, a BofA Global equity strategist. The shift could have serious ramifications for the stock market that many investors arent yet taking seriously.

Stagflation refers to simultaneously elevated inflation and weak economic growth, which bedeviled the U.S. economy for most of the 1970s and into the early 1980s. Goldilocks refers to when an economy is growing at a moderate pace thats not hot enough to stoke inflation.

Earlier this week, investors digested two hotter-than-expected inflation reports. Consumer prices rose at a rate of 3.2% over the past 12 months, and the rate could accelerate to 3.6% by June, Hartnett said.

Traders are currently pricing in more than 50% probability that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in June, for the first time since it began raising them in March 2022, according to the CME Groups FedWatch Tool.

Signs of a revival in inflation arent confined to the U.S., Hartnett said. Accelerating price pressures around the world have already inspired some emerging-markets central banks to pause plans to cut interest rates.","2","O"

If an AI suddenly causes significant damages, rules will be changed prior to full collapse because protecting personal wealth is the great societal unifier. 

Most means of collapse are avoidable. The governments would eventually agree to call it a mulligan, sort things out, and society would survive because were all just folks in the end.




Long answer: The current AI is based on advanced search algorithms and is poorly regulated market. Either there will be a problem allowed by lack of regulation that gets people killed or causes a rapid/unpredicted change in the market. After the SNAFU, either a governing body will regulate AI or the first group to map the marketplace to the point where it can monitor/manipulate all other AI will take control.

Next Gen AI will resolve the fidelity problem (Skynet scenarios) by having dedicated teams of experts moderating the results to prevent catastrophic liabilities. Right now, if any of the AI firms move too quickly and they fuck up along the way, thats their ass, so the likelihood of an unintentional Skynet happening in the next 3 years low.

After ~3 years, we may reach the Sauron problem, in which a 2nd Gen Econ AI tries to corner some market by being trained to manipulate the first generation AI. However, creating such a disastrous AI is problematic for all players, so legislation will probably be passed to prevent it.

If a foreign power tries to ratfuck other countries using a Sauron AI, that would be bad. But if it crashes the stock market or turns off electric grids, etc, the economy would still be correctable, though a war economy isnt fun.","3","N"

"https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1bg6uib/polish_clothing_giant_lpp_sees_share_price/","BubsyFanboy","2024-03-16",1710601922,1,1,0,0,"&gt;Polands biggest clothing company LPP, owner of brands such as Reserved, Cropp and Mohito, has seen its shares nosedive on Friday after a US investment research firm published a report alleging LPP has secretly maintained its operations in Russia despite pledging to leave.

&gt;The company has lost about 11 billion zloty (¬2.5 billion) in market capitalisation and ended the day with an almost 36% drop in share prices.

&gt;LPP denounced the accusations, saying the report prepared by Hindenburg Research was part of an organised disinformation attack designed to drive down its share price.


&gt;The report, published on Friday morning and titled Operating Behind Enemy Lines, presented evidence purporting to show that LPP carried out a sham sale of its business in Russia and, in fact, continues to profit from the countrys market despite EU sanctions and public disapproval.

&gt;LPP, which has 2,206 stores with a total of over 1.9 million square meters of retail space across 27 countries, was valued at 33.1 billion zloty (¬7.7 billion) before todays falls. In the fiscal year ending in January 2023, it recorded revenue of 15.9 billion zloty (¬3.7 billion).

&gt;Hindenburg Research noted that, despite LPP saying it lost about 20% of revenue from divesting its Russian operations in June 2022, it still saw noted that total revenue remarkably grow 13% overall.

&gt;The research company also pointed out that LPPs reported rise in revenue across markets excluding Russia was  40.5% year-on-year, a level virtually unheard of in the retail apparel industry.

&gt;We believe LPP was able to post these remarkable results because its divestment of its Russia business has been a complete sham, wrote Hindenburg Research, which specialises in researching cases of alleged corporate fraud and malfeasance.


&gt;Russia was LPPs biggest international market before the invasion of Ukraine. But, like many international firms, soon after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Polish firm announced that it would divest its Russian business.

&gt;LPP said it sold its Russian assets, called RE Trading, to a Chinese consortium in a $382 million deal (¬350 million).

&gt;We found that the buyer was a Dubai-based shell called Far East Services with no disclosure of its owners or directors, wrote Hindenburg Research, which attached to its report a document from the Russian tax authority, showing that the sale of 95% of LPPs Russian subsidiary was finalised on 30 June 2022.

&gt;Far East Services was incorporated just one day before LPP announced it had reached an agreement to sell its Russian subsidiary, noted the research company, adding that Far East Services has no externally verifiable presence, track record in the fashion industry, or apparent associations with China.","1","I"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1bg6uib/polish_clothing_giant_lpp_sees_share_price/","BubsyFanboy","2024-03-16",1710605018,1,1,0,0,"&gt;Hindenburg Research also claims to have confirmed the false nature of the divestment with former senior LPP employees and managers, who reportedly claim that LPPs Russian operations are still directly controlled by LPP HQ and board.

&gt;A former manager described LPP CEO and founder Marek Piechockis approach: He didnt give a f*ck about some war between Russia and Ukraine. This [war] is just temporary, they quoted an anonymous former employee as saying.

&gt;In December 2023, Hindenburg Research also dispatched secret shoppers to Far East Services flagship stores in Moscow and St Petersburg.

&gt;They found that almost all garments were identical designs and colours to fall/winter collections in LPP´s online catalogues in Poland, indicating that LPPs products are still somehow making their way into Russia at least 18 months after the claimed divestiture.


&gt;The research company alleged that LPP waas managing to supply the Russian market using Kazakhstan as a backdoor.

&gt;Import-export records show that LPP shipped ~$755 million of merchandise to its Kazakh subsidiary in 2023, despite Kazakhstan only accounting for 1% of LPPs brick-and-mortar stores, they said.

&gt;They Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan have seen a rise in Polish imports since the invasion of Ukraine, with many firms believed to be using them as a way to indirectly ship products to Russia, bypassing sanctions.

&gt;Hindenberg Research also accused LPP of accounting manipulation to cover its tracks. It noted that over two thirds of the firms revenue growth in 2022/23 was reported as being in an unexplained Other segment of its annual report, much higher than in previous years.


&gt;LPP has strongly denied the allegation in several statements published throughout Friday. It called the contents of the report either false or manipulated, saying it is part of an organised disinformation attack, which has been in preparation for the last five months and is designed to drive down the LPP Groups share price.

&gt;It announced that it has notified prosecutors in Poland about a possible offence to the detriment of LPP SA and its shareholders, listed investors, threatening the security of the financial market.

&gt;Hindenburg Research did disclose that, following its investigation, the company has taken a short position in shares of LPP S.A., meaning it is betting on its further falls.","1_1","I"

I think you are making things up in your head to judge those around you and continue to blame the people, rather than identify the fundamental issues in the system.  
  
This is corporate and billionaire propaganda 101. While there are people who waste too much on things like UberEats, it is not most people and it is not the cause of stagnating wages, greedflation, Citizens United, ongoing regulatory capture, private investors buying up huge portions of single family homes in order to rent in perpetuity, the artificial push for return-to-office, and everything else I'm too exhausted to keep listing over and over and over","10_2_1_1_1_1_1_1_1","I"

We're talking places that have been around for 30+ even 60+ years. We've lost a lot of gems. Even fast food and corporatized food-product places have gotten the chop.

The only places surviving right now are really high end places that cater to the wealthy (who are doing better than ever) and ghost kitchens, as well as those little taco stands that set up shop on the sidewalks.

But again, it's LA... we have the extremes. The wealthy who are unaffected and the poor who might be hanging on by a thread because they live in crowded, rent-controlled dwellings.

I'm in an RSO building with 2 1 bedroom units occupied by 5+ person families.

No one is whining here, people are just trying their best to get by but it's cracking pretty badly here.

As someone finishing up school and trying to return to the workforce, I'm looking at pure hell unless I go back to doing what I was doing before college... or... the fucking reason I went to college in the first place... to stop cutting the bare minimum of wages.

The most money I've made in my life was $16 an hour back in 2011. 

But I guess I have to walk back into the wall of minimum wage shit given the state of the economy.

&gt;Burger King has seen three of its large-scale franchise partners declare bankruptcy this year. Both Meridian Restaurants Unlimited, which operated 115 Burger Kings, and Toms King, which had 90 locations, filed [Chapter 11 bankruptcy](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/b/chapter-11-bankruptcy) in the first quarter.  
  
They have been joined by Premier Kings, which runs 172 Burger King locations and has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. That followed a sister company, Premier Cajun Kings, which operated 19 Popeye's locations, filing for Chapter 11 earlier this year. Popeye's also falls under the Restaurant Brands International banner.

By the way if you think things are expensive now, wait until it becomes apparent we no longer have enough energy oil production to keep up with demand. Democrats will prove to be right about energy. Drill baby drill will be the death of this country. There is not enough oil to keep this up. This inflation people are complaining about will look like nothing.

The person who controls a resource controls the prices demanded for it, aka ""the law of supply and demand"", which, btw, is *NOT* any sort of natural law, but rather a justification for greedy exploitation. Restrict the supply, and you have a reason to charge more. Eliminate alternatives, you get to charge more. Deliberately fail to stockpile against disasters, you get to charge more.. Buy favorable legislation from politicians, you get to charge more.

Printing money doesn't cause inflation any more than fractional reserve banking does, they are identical, the only difference being who is creating the money and who benefits from it.

Inflation is caused by the *choice* to charge more in order to increase profits. The record profits posted by corporations shows that there has been no *necessity* to raise prices. The fact that markets have been monopolized by a few colluding agencies that has given them the ability to raise prices with impunity is the root cause of inflation. When the government gave out pandemic funds, the wealthy saw that as an opportunity to claim it via inflation. The public was merely a conduit used to transfer the cash, much like money put into Native reservations never stayed there, but was instead transferred to the local white economy, and didn't ever improve things for the reservations.

The ""supply chain disruptions"" were caused by poor management practices...the ""just-in-time"" model that relied upon perfect stability along the chain...that ensured that any event that caused a disruption at any point would multiply and magnify through the system, creating shortages that would justify price increases due to ""supply and demand"". It resulted in record profits and record wealth transfers to the billionaires.

No one *forced* them to raise prices, or to keep prices high after those disruptions were resolved.

Choices made by billionaires to benefit themselves, not the esoteric and undefined ""market forces"" so beloved by economists. Might as well claim it was the hand of God that caused inflation.","35","I"

I appreciate the additional details. If you're happy then stay in that mindset because that's already a positive. But in reality, in 2024 with how much inflation we've experienced and how much of it is greedflation from monopolies and deregulation and bailouts with our tax dollars, yes that is now shit wages where you will have to rent for the rest of your life (unless you have parents with a lot of money to help), and it's not your fault, but it's also silly to say that because of your anecdote everything is sunshine and rainbows in the US.  
  
You are young and living out in the middle of nowhere in presumably a very low cost of living area (not hard to find in bumfuck Ohio of all places), so I can't use you as an example to get a pulse on how *everyone* is doing, especially because when you're young you're just happy to not have to have roommates or be away from parents.  But 64k today is not what 64k was in 2020, and it's definitely not what it was in 2010, and depending on your career path I'd anticipate hitting a relative ceiling on that income soon.","54_1_1_1","F"

The idea is that people will spend less and the economy will slow down if their savings are growing faster, because putting off a purchase gives you more purchasing power the next day.

It's a moot and obsolete point because anyone today and automatically invest their paycheck into stocks/bitcoin/land or another deflationary asset and convert back to cash before a purchase easily with modern banking apps. So anyone that wants to can still choose to delay spending for that benefit, it's not longer at the whim of the fed.","1_2","I"

The borrower with a ton of debt always wants the debt to be inflated away so they can repay it with less valuable dollars. If deflation happen its the worst case scenario, less (tax) revenue and debt repayments become more burdensome.

WFH just means employers can hire anyone anywhere for the lowest wage possible and that's if they even need to hire a human, because of AI they might not even need to hire anyone.

The wealth effect then takes hold and the money continues its funneling in the economy to bigger houses, and more consumption of fewer and fewer, richer and richer people.  This inequality is almost impossible to reverse unless the field of economics cant understand the basics like this simple idea.  Economics for a time was all about equaling the playing field.  The reality is its just another of a long list of fields now that makes the rich people richer.

When you give a bank a £$¬50 note and get a demand deposit balance of £$¬50 in return, you are exchanging one financial asset for another. You are swapping a claim on the central bank (the cash currency) for a claim on your commercial bank. They are different types of money, just denominated in the same unit of account: the state's.

From your commercial bank's perspective, they are accepting a claim on the central bank from you (cash currency) in exchange for issuing you their IOU (bank money in the form of your deposit balance).

The entirety of your demand deposit account is a liability of your bank. Banks used to actually issue paper bank money. This bank money is what you hold as an asset/financial claim on your bank.

The government could (and imo should) insure 100% of people's bank deposit accounts (no person should lose bank credit in today's modern system just because a bank made poor investment or loan decisions) but that wouldn't change what I'm saying.

The same goes for loans. The old, incorrect view asserts that savers deposit cash with their bank, who go on to act as an intermediary by loaning out, say, 90% of that cash to someone else to earn interest.

That's **not** how it works.

In the act of making a loan, a bank **creates** the demand deposit balance used to purchase the resource (eg. a house or car). It is **not** reliant on deposits from savers in order to ""fund"" loans. The bank creates no broad money when it lends.

The reserves sitting in the asset side of the banking system, of course, are used to settle any payment instructions made between banks but reserves are **always** made available to banks for settlement **after** loans are made and are **not** a constraint on the lending process as the incorrect classical fractional reserve banking tale asserts.","2_1_1_1_1_1_1_1","I"

Instead, california imports all of its crude from foreign countries, namely: Russia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Columbia, Venezuela, etc. as the largest food producer in the country. Disruptions in foreign oil trade will have effects on California food producers and thus affect food prices across the US.

With the conflict in Ukraine and the U.S. shipping gas to Europe and expanding into China.

South and Central American countries are reliant on a higher price of oil.  A state like Venezuela is entirely dependent on a higher price of oil.

The U.S. has sanctions on Venezuela that negatively impacts its economy.

The U.S. while all this has been happening has not focused on cost of living increases or inflation.  We are on the brink of a major recession.  How we calculate consumer price increases and inflation was changed a few decades ago and the numbers being reported are not a good indication of the state of our economy.  The status of our economy has nothing to do with the strength of Wall Street.  The stock prices of 30-500 multi national corporations do not reflect the health of tens of millions of American businesses.

This is why the price of oil dropped, and what is contributing to the destabilization of South and Central American states leading to the increases in immigration.

If anyone wanted to solve the issue of immigration we would be removing the rest of the sanctions on Venezuela, and cutting production of oil and gas.

Preventing the manipulation by large business and banks of the market through their consolidation, creating manufactured supply line shortages.  Prices for fuel are already starting to increase again due to preventable refinery and infrastructure closures...This will lead to significant cost of living increases and shotgun everyone straight into a recession.

The U.S. should have significantly reduced the shipping of gas overseas and developed better relations with Venezuela at the start of Bidens administration, instead he went the other route.

The U.S. should also pressure Europe to take in refugees from and send increasing amounts of aid to their former African colonies that only gained independence in the 60s.  If the E.U. refuses to comply just stop sending aid and funding to pay for the deficit in costs caused by African immigration to the U.S.

Over 7 million immigrants have crossed the border under Biden and the Federal government are not providing the funds to manage their care, and their policies are guaranteed to generate significantly increased numbers.","2_4","N"

**[Donald Trump Built a National Debt So Big (Even Before the Pandemic) That Itll Weigh Down the Economy for Years](https://www.propublica.org/article/national-debt-trump)**

 &gt;After he took office, Trump predicted that economic growth created by the 2017 tax cut, combined with the proceeds from the tariffs he imposed on a wide range of goods from numerous countries, would help eliminate the budget deficit and let the U.S. begin to pay down its debt. On July 27, 2018, he told Sean Hannity of Fox News: We have $21 trillion in debt. When this [the 2017 tax cut] really kicks in, well start paying off that debt like its water.

&gt;Nine days later, he tweeted, Because of Tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 trillion in debt that has been accumulated, much by the Obama Administration.

&gt;Thats not how it played out. When Trump took office in January 2017, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was projecting that federal budget deficits would be 2% to 3% of our gross domestic product during Trumps term. Instead, the deficit reached nearly 4% of gross domestic product in 2018 and 4.6% in 2019.

If we want a fair comparison, we should compare Biden's 1 term + Obama's 2 terms along with Trump's 1 term + W Bush's 2 terms. An equal comparison between three Democratic terms and three Republican terms.

If you want, we can add Clinton's 2 terms and H.W. Bush's 1 term to the comparison. In that case, there are five Democratic terms and four Republican terms. Even though the Democrats 'ruled' for one term more than the Republicans, which party added more to the national debt ? =","9_2_1_1_1_1","I"

Month over month, California has the second largest net job gains of any state, after New York.

By percentage, California has the 10th largest month-over-month increase of jobs.

Year-over-year, California has the 3rd largest net increase in jobs of any state.

By percentage, year-over-year California is middle of the road at 26th in the nation.

Needless to say, I'm skeptical of this ad-ridden article that never explicitly states how they're measuring this claim that seems to run contrary to the available evidence. Even that article states a few things that seems to completely contradict the title's claim

&gt;""Yes, California  the nations largest job market  has consistently outperformed most states. Over 50 years, Californias 1.8% average annual growth ranks No. 19 and beats the 1.5% national pace.""

1) Corporations don't pay taxes. Any effort to make corporations pay higher taxes comes at the expense of consumers in the form of higher prices, the employees in the form of lower wages or in the stockholders in the form of lower dividends. 

2) Corporations don't get refunds. They are allowed to carry losses forward to offset profits in the future but Uncle Sam doesn't write ABC Corp a check if they lose money.

3) Corporate C Suite and CEOs are highly valued members of the corporate team charged with the responsibility to A) manage 100s or thousands of employees (for instance Amazon has 1.5 million people) B) oversees $Billions in assets, liabilities and revenue, and C) sets the strategic path for the business. Good ones are hard to come by, have 30+ years of experience and are compensated accordingly. 

4) Corporations have a fiduciary responsibility to the stockholder to maximize the value of the company NOT to address ""National Needs""   If the business is successful, national needs are met by the taxes the corporation pays in payroll taxes, property taxes, workers comp and unemployment taxes. employee benefits and in the payroll they contribute to their local community.","4","I"

Mass Modern Immigration is less about giving people an better life,its an business.

The most commonplace contract is the Singapore model,the worker has little to no chance to become an citizen, to bring his family in the country and he is literally exploited.

Mass Media is creating friction between working class people but in reality business owners(also known as ""lords"" here) are the only people winning from this arrangement.

As for keeping wages low,arguably business owners never intended to increases wages in the first place,either because they can't or they won't.

Now let's talk about the good type of immigration:since communism we had a lot of foreign students with the express focus to increase good relationships between us and underveloped nations.Right now palestinian national Raed Arafat is the head of SMURD,an special medical health division he created and saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

Foreign doctors or those of foreign origin are more highly regarded than romanian ones since they have higher work ethics,don't accept bribes and are more skilled.

So my point is that immigration can help certain people, not always the country or the immigrants in equal ways.If immigration is used as an tool for someone else's enrichment, then its an net negative.","1","I"

The arguments get muddied by other values and I suspect this is why there is so much intellectual dishonesty instead of simply trying to mitigate the potentially harmful effects immigration has on some populations.

I think we're at the point where studies will show whatever the people funding them want them to show.

Immigration of skilled workers with jobs awaiting for them is clearly a benefit for the economy as a whole (but they so suppress wages for Americans) while uneducated undocumented and criminally unvetted immigrants is a different story with very different cost-benefit math.

&gt;Only 44% of Americans surveyed said they **could** use their savings to pay for an unexpected expense

So lets read the underlying report.
&gt;Many would borrow in an emergency. Only 44% of U.S. adults **would** pay an emergency expense of $1,000 or more from their savings, as of December 2023 polling. 35% would borrow money, including 21% who would finance with a credit card 

There is a big difference between ""could"" and ""would"".   Now seeing that I am getting ""Low Current Balance Alert"" from my credit union, I'm not particularly liquid at this time, but I would be by the time my credit card that I would use for the $1000 expense is due.  

The credit card is my emergency funding source.

I ""wouldn't"" use debit because federal price controls makes it economically stupid to carry large balances at banks, but I easily could maintain a $1000 balance at the bank, or a $10,000 balance, or a $100,000 balance.   But because of the interest rate situation, it is extremely stupid to do so.  If they were paying 5¼% interest on savings accounts like the old days, there would be $1000 sitting in the bank tomorrow.

Why would I have debit at an institution that pays a negative ""real"" interest rate?  That's how you fall behind.

Way I would do it, I punch up $1k on the credit card, and it is an interest free loan so long as I pay it the following month.   I could sell some GLD to do it.   Anyhow, as soon as my tax refund hits, I'll have over $1k debit.  I *would* still use a no interest if paid in full credit card even if I *could* use debit.

For example, a brand new BMW M3 lets say is around $85,000. By financial guidance advice/metrics, someone should be making close to 500k a year to reasonably comfortably afford the car. That would obviously limit the market to such a small amount of people.

Yet, a bunch of Americans buy new cars or spend a similar amount of money on cars every year with essentially fake money (credit) and financing. Wouldnt this lead to bad effects on the economy as well? Financing for example like mortgages, are obviously to me very reasonable and needed for our economy but on most other things? It seems the consumer rate expenditure does not make sense. Which is why we see these statistics of Americans not being able to afford a $1k emergency which is insane. 1 out of 2 people not being able to afford that without credit? What is this going to lead to at this rate with the cost of everything only rising with wages not staying at the same pace? More credit spending ? When does the bubble burst ?","4_1_2","O"

The apartment upstairs looks exactly like mine. When it became vacant, they listed it for $550 more per month than I'm currently paying. It was scooped up immediately.

That's what it's like living close to a major city right now. Your rent is rapidly rising, but the price of vacant apartments is even higher, so you cling to what you have because it would cost $550 more per month to get back to the same quality of life you already have now.","6_1_1_1_1","O"

The one major drain that I could cut is how much I put into retirement, but with a 50% company matching 401k, it would be stupid not to take the upper limit on that, especially since I never had the opportunity to save anything for retirement when I was younger.

You said your apartment rent is lower than the going rate as well. All of that info, you're lying about something. Guessing it's the spending problem of stuff you don't need.

You mentioned your company matches 50% into your 401k. Mine does 100% match on 3% I put in of my paychecks. Yes, it would be amazing for me to put in 10% of my income and have my company match 5% of that. But that doesn't make sense in doing because I would have less income to pay bills, buy new items, invest outside of stock market, etc.

Edited to add - and this is just my opinion based on what I've read. There might be a legal case for discrimination if someone can show that the 100% remote workers at Dell largely belong to a protected class, such as if they are over 40 years old.

The consensus was that the worlds largest economy would slip into recession last year. Instead it grew by 3pc. Unemployment hasnt been this low for this long in 50 years. Wages are climbing. The stock market is going gangbusters.

&gt;The trouble is, voters arent buying it. Almost six in every 10 voters polled by CBS News described the US economy under Biden as bad. Stranger still, the main reason for faster-than-expected growth appears to be the gusto with which Americans are hitting the malls. One economist says, the average American appears to be miserable, but still spending.

Many continue to praise the booming economy as if anyone other than corporations are benefiting from it.

If the public were so concerned about the overall economy as they are about layoffs in the tech industry, they might notice and learn some new things.","16","N"

Part of the attractiveness of key indicators is that we can come to a broad conclusion about something looking at one indicator. However, one algorithm isn't going to give you a *conclusive* idea about the overall state of anything.

This isn't a condemnation of any one methodology vs another, but it is a cautionary note to look at several other indicators along with ANY one single indicator to gain a more holistic glimpse of what a key indicator may be suggesting and how valid it may be.

But if housing takes more of your paycheck than ever and your credit card and car payments are up due to higher interest rates, it can feel very inflationary even if CPI doesn't reflect it.

As you said, if we really want to understand how people are doing, we should be looking at disposable income AFTER autonomous consumption. 

Then overlay that with consumer debt and loan delinquencies and CPI or whatever measure you judge to be the best.  But we do not do that because that would be bad news. 

I think an ideal graph would contain all of those components so people could weigh these things and develop their own conclusions. 

Many times in my professional life, I would convey  bad news with graphs with several metrics because if I made a case for something on one principal, then my take on it would be more susceptible to what others perceived as my bias or misinterpretation. 

There is the reality of political economy in economic measurements. So by using several measurements, you essentially spread the risk of you being perceived as trying to garner political economy for a specific point of view.

Millions of Americans have signed a contract during their hiring that says if they boycott Israel they give up their job. In 37 states an oath of loyalty to Israel is a requirement for a government job or to work as a government contractor.

You can boycott all the other stuff, no problem, but if you stop buying Israeli goods, even accidentally, you could be in violation of your oath of loyalty and lose your job.

If you're going to boycott something, and you live in one of [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-BDS_laws#/media/File:Antibds_laws.png) states, please check that it isn't made in Israel, first, so you don't get in legal trouble.

In case you haven't seen the news, Israel is not fucking around these days. It takes 5 seconds to check where something is made. Don't lose your job over this.

Edit: I'm just trying to help people understand the law. Here in Indiana we've had loyalty to Israel laws since 2016.

the US economy? Doesn't exist because it's not fair to all the players.

It's not considered an economy imo. players that enable other players to become rich in an economy and scam other players to benefit themselves without punishment isn't an economy. that's just called being evil and stealing. if another player can steal from a poor player, poor player is allowed to steal from rich player. to be a functioning economy is to follow strict laws and rules that protect and apply to each player regardless of society status, family name, etc

an economy that is pay to win at life isn't an economy. many top players today, pay to win and stay indefinitely. 

capitalism, social, comm, imp, etc? all economic systems are better if designed impartial and fair to every player, that is what we want

In regards to Israel, I would agree with you. AIPAC is an extremely powerful lobby, many Jewish politicians are dual citizens, and many evangelical Christians in America believe in Christian Zionism which is essentially supportive of the state of Israel. 

However, the Russia Ukraine thing is much different. Much of America is actually Russophobia due to the long Cold War which is indelible in the minds of Boomers as much as Christian Zionism is. Its unquestionable to them that Israel is good and Russia is bad. 

I highly doubt Russia has anywhere near as much political power in the U.S. to actually be a significant reason as to why the legislation for providing support to Ukraine is held up. There is a genuine feeling of resent meant in many Americans that the administration is characterizing Russia-Ukraine war as a threat to our security but exacerbating the problem at the Southern Border. You may disagree with that assessment and thats fine. However, it is a legitimate good faith belief by many Americans. How do I know? Because I share it. I say this as someone who in their professional capacity is deeply involved with providing the material assistance to Ukraine from the DOD.  

The final aspect of the Russia-Ukraine issue is that there is not really any conceivable scenario where Ukraine actually wins. Another hard to swallow pill but it is the truth. Theres a mix of reasons why and the holdup of aid right now probably isnt in the top 5. The biggest issues are manpower, air superiority, integration, and mass.

To provide you an example. Ill use fake numbers to just illustrate the problem and not get close to real data. Say Ukraine has 100 artillery pieces. They have roughly 50 in 155mm donated from NATO and 50 in 152mm which are what they started the war with from their Soviet times. Even if the west gives them near unlimited 155mm rounds they will still only be firing 50 guns at any given time. Its incredibly hard for the west to get any 152mm ammunition because many dont actually make it and those who do arent exactly friendly to us (Russia, China, NK, Iran). Now lets say Russia has 200 or 250 artillery pieces. They can fire nearly all pieces all day because they dont have the same integration issues of 155mm that Ukraine does. Ukraine will never be able to keep up with volume of fire. 

I could go on and on in regards to air supremacy, lessened utility of armor, drone usage, etc. 

With that known, why should the US pour hundreds of billions into a loss? Sure, it hurts Russia but its also dragging on a war that if it isnt negotiated to a close soon may see a total collapse of the UAF which would result in the complete seizure of Ukraine as opposed to maybe just Donbas if negotiated. 

I hope that clears things up for you as to why these are very very different things.","1","N"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1bixekg/inflation_influence_tool_read_comments/","ethancgb","2024-03-19",1710887326,1,1,0,0,"With the anticipation and influence inflation reports will have on the market likely until rates are cut, I had the thought that it may be useful to create a tool that can measure the influence that inflation reports (particularly when it's hotter or cooler than expected) have on individual securities. It essentially combines the significance of the stock movements when a report is released, with the correlation it has with cool &amp; hot inflation  
The math behind it:  
For each inflation report released since Jan of 2022, I recorded if the reported inflation was above or below the consensus. Then, I calculated the returns of the stock on those days that the inflation reports were published. I then converted the percent returns to movements measured in standard deviations. Then, I compiled the average movements in STD DEVS for the times when reported inflation was -0.3 , -0.2 , -0.1, 0.1 , 0.2, and 0.3 percentage points below/above the consensus. Then, I measured the Reactivity taking the average of all the movements when inflation was below/above the consensus. This is how much (in standard deviations) a stock will move on average when inflation is below/ above the consensus. Then, I found the correlation (R\^2) that the movements had with the degree to which the inflation was above/below. In theory, a stock with complete influence from inflation should have a perfect linear relation (Losing more when inflation is hot, gaining more when inflation is cool, or perfectly vice versa). By then multiplying the R\^2 by the Reactivity, the Influence is found. This metric essentially means the degree to which this stock will react to an above/below consensus inflation report in a linear and predictable manner.

For example, let's say a local shoemaker gives the baker down the street a pair of new shoes on credit. They're old friends, the baker fell on hard times due to a grain shortage, and the shoemaker knows the baker is good for it and is happy to help him out because he knows it's a tough time.

That would be neutral or even beneficial.

Now let's say it's ten years down the road, the grain shortage is over, and the baker is doing booming business. He needs to expand his operation by installing more ovens. The guy down the street who makes the ovens advances him said ovens, and the baker pays him back over time with interest.

So that neutral creation of credit got the baker through the rough times and now he's using credit to increase aggregate supply.

Where things go off the rails is when credit is misused/abused to increase aggregate demand without increasing aggregate supply. Like if someone takes out a loan to buy a new car they can't really afford just because they want their neighbors to think they're rich.

Whenever you use credit, you're artificially increasing the money supply to buy something you actually can't afford. Since money is representative of goods and services, you're basically trading your future labor output for current goods and services. If you use the borrowed money to increase your output (like the baker buying more ovens), then you've used credit responsibly. But if you use it in ways that undermine your future output, like making irresponsible purchases, then you've undermined the entire economy by printing money that won't be met by a proportional increase in supply.

When you get lots of people using credit irresponsibly, the supply of money goes up faster than the supply of goods and services, and that's what destroys economies and currencies. Unfortunately, human nature being what it is, you can always count on it. Every economy and every currency will end up being destroyed in the end by consumer greed. That's why we get credit cycles and related boom bust cycles, and that's why people who understand that basic principle can consistently make money in the markets.","1","N"

My concern or outlook is, the cost of living is rising well above the average wages and income. If most Americans are paycheck to paycheck already, and the only way for extra spending is for a MAJORITY to put it on credit, when does the limit get hit? Is there even a limit? At what point does it become too much and as you mentioned the aggregate demand and aggregate supply is negatively exceeding the positive correlation needed for sustainability. The bubble has to burst at some point right? Am I ignorant and just dont know what Im talking about here? If people cant even barley afford to have shelter, will things come down? Will that cause a depression like state ? Or will the credit machine just keep the inflating going on unrealistic spending levels. But for how long can that go on? Just things I think about.

You know, out of the dozens of people I've explained this to, you might be the only person who actually understood any of it. I've tried to explain it to random people online, friends and family (to warn them what's about to happen), and nobody even begins to get it.

As for how much longer it can continue, I don't know. Considering we're at the point now where people are literally financing cups of coffee, I have to think the end is near. But whether that's next week or a decade from now, I don't know. Nobody does. People in the early 1980s thought the end of the dollar was then, and then China opened to the west and created a whole new market for US debt.

The wildcard right now is immigration. If we can import enough warm bodies into our economy, we can increase GDP, increase demand for goods and services, and, eventually, increase demand for new loans. It seems the plan is to get these fresh immigrants into the military and rapidly transform them into debt slaves, which could hypothetically work, if it's done on a large enough scale and rapidly enough.

We need to expand the money supply by about ten trillion dollars practically overnight. That would stop the deflation in money supply and get the economy growing again, bring interest rates back down, and the newly minted Americans would create enough demand to keep the currently saturated debt slaves employed. And we would get to survive another few years, perhaps even a decade or more.

I doubt it's going to work with 100% success. I imagine the reality will land somewhere between abysmal failure and spectacular success. So maybe recession but not all out deflationary death spiral resulting in the debt bubble completely bursting. As long as the derivatives market doesn't implode, we can still pull out of this.","1_1_1_1_1","N"

I think its kind of hard to grasp overall just how capitalism and the economy truly works. Most people understand the basic premises but dont really analyze whats going on or how money moves or works (especially when talking inflation, credit, interest, debts, and tax rates). It seems simple but factoring in over expenditure, debts like never before seen, cost of living rising well above average wages, and how people are financing basic things, the way it all comes together can be a little mind boggling or hard to understand. Speaking for myself, just coming up with these questions, it truly starts to make less sense to me how any of it works in reality. 

I know In principle (like the example you gave with the shoemaker and the baker) that it makes more sense, but we know thats not how it truly is working on the grand scale. The elites and the powers that be always used financing and debt to give the average person spending power and ability to obtain goods, services, vehicles, and property, but what if these debts get to proportions (such as student loan debt) where its almost unimaginable that all of that can be paid back. Im saying that as a rhetorical question. I know I basically asked that in a number of different ways already, but its just really interesting to me the way the economy is going and how it all works. The mass amount of debt the average person takes on is something that scares me.

One of my assessments is that the rich or elite class of today are far greedier then ever before and they keep allowing (like weve always) the average person to take on financing and debt at higher levels (student loans example) to appear as if profits or money flow is generating upwards in profits. However I think its creating a vortex to where so much of it is on credit/financing that they over extended there hand in giving out money, and the average American is over extended in ever being able to pay that off while also having a family, shelter, and basic needs. (Including all overall debts here). That in turn is going to create a burst at some point I think when it overlaps and people can no longer even sustain themselves alongside the debt. There only options would to just take on more debt which eventually has to reach a breaking point. I hope this made somewhat sense.","1_1_1_1_1_1","O"

That means all monetary systems are inherently ponzi schemes.

This is unavoidable. It's unavoidable because you can't stop people from creating credit. Like the government could ban banks and ban lending, but they can't stop people from loaning each other money or fronting them goods and services for interest. I mean look at the entire illicit drug trade, that's how it works, and they obviously can't stop it. So credit is an unavoidable part of any economy. You can't stop it, and you can't stop people from being stupid with it.

Now the degree to which the system can get out of control can be limited. Like before the creation of the federal reserve, there was a very minor (by today's standards) boom bust cycle every five to ten years. It's trying to prevent these boom bust cycles that is really the greatest evil in our economy. Doing everything they can to keep kicking the can down the road.

The boom bust cycles are necessary to reset the credit and prevent hyperbubbles from forming. Honestly, I think the answer is really imposing busts vs trying to prevent them. Have a jubilee every so often like the Jews used to. It's interesting their debt jubilees came every seven years, and it was every five to ten years that we had a bust in a more organic economy before central banking took over.","1_1_1_1_1_1_1","N"

There's a reason governments spend so many taxpayer dollars digging their economies out of recessions. Families lose their homes. Children go malnourished. New grads spend years struggling to get their careers back on track, forgoing marriage and kids and homeownership. But a growing body of research suggests that recessions are good for at least one thing: longevity. Puzzlingly, it appears that economic downturns actually extend people's lives.

The latest evidence comes from ""[Lives vs. Livelihoods](https://www.nber.org/papers/w32110),"" a new paper by four researchers led by the renowned health economist Amy Finkelstein. They found that during the Great Recession, from 2007 to 2009, age-adjusted mortality rates among Americans dropped 0.5% for every jump of 1 percentage point in an area's unemployment rate. The more joblessness, the longer people lived  especially adults over 64 and those without a college education.

""These mortality reductions appear immediately,"" the economists concluded, ""and they persist for at least 10 years."" The effects were so large that the recession effectively provided 4% of all 55-year-olds with an extra year of life. And in states that saw big jumps in unemployment, people were more likely to report being in excellent health. Recessions, it would seem, help us stay fitter, and live longer.

The question, of course, is why. The economists ruled out a lot of possible explanations. Laid-off workers weren't using their free time to exercise more, or cutting back on smoking or drinking because money was tight. Infectious diseases like influenza and pneumonia kept right on spreading, even though fewer people were going to work and dining out. Retirees didn't seem to be getting better care, even though rising unemployment rates made it easier for nursing homes to staff up. So what could the explanation be? How does higher unemployment lead to longer life?

The answer was pollution. Counties that experienced the biggest job losses in the Great Recession, the economists found, also saw the largest declines in air pollution, as measured by levels of the fine particulate matter PM2.5. It makes sense: During recessions, fewer people drive to work. Factories and offices slow down, and people cut back on their own energy use to save money. All that reduced activity leads to cleaner air. That would explain why workers without a college degree enjoyed the biggest drops in mortality: People with low-wage jobs tend to live in neighborhoods with more environmental toxins. It would also explain why the recession reduced mortality from heart disease, suicide, and car crashes  causes of death all linked to the physical and mental effects of PM2.5. Overall, the economists found, cleaner air was responsible for more than a third of the decline in mortality during the Great Recession.","1","N"

White-collar crime is not treated the same as street crime in capitalist countries. In fact, some of the MSM articles written by the news agencies are sprinkling in statements like ""Amnesty International says Vietnam is secretive about its death penalty, and uses lethal injection."" And? The United States is secretive about what goes on in its prisons and also uses lethal injection.

[Example from AFP](https://bilyonaryo.com/2024/03/19/prosecutors-call-for-death-sentence-in-12-5-billion-fraud-case-involving-vietnamese-property-tycoon/money/)

&gt;...The country is notoriously secretive about its executions  carried out by lethal injection since 2013 instead of firing squad  but Amnesty International estimates that scores are carried out each year...

That sentence is designed to cast doubt on the integrity of the Vietnamese legal system, and by extension, on the proposed sentence, and could even be an attempt to get the reader to doubt the justice of punishing a tycoon.

&gt;...The case has shocked Vietnam and led hundreds to stage protests in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City  a rarity in the one-party communist state...

This sentence is designed to make Vietnam look like a failed state that is not responding to public concerns and needs 'freedom'.

&gt;...Lans arrest and prosecution comes as part of a nationwide crackdown on corruption, which has swept up senior officials and members of the countrys business elite in recent years...

This sentence is to make the reader associate the communist Vietnamese government with corruption.

&gt;...Alongside Lan, 85 others are facing charges including bribery and abuse of power at the trial in the southern business hub of Ho Chi Minh City. 

&gt;Eight are on the run, including two Chinese nationals...

This part is to make the reader associate this story with China. 86 people arrested for this fraud, 2 of them supposedly Chinese, and the article makes a separate paragraph to point out and highlight those 2 Chinese.

As is the part below:

&gt;...Lan, who is married to a wealthy Hong Kong businessman, is accused of creating nearly 1,300 fake loan applications between 2012 and 2022 to withdraw money from SCB, in which she owned a 90 percent stake...","1_2","I"

Alabama tried to execute a poor guy recently and failed. So they switched to a new method and it worked on the first guy. But when they tried the second method on someone else it didn't work.

We all know exactly what they are doing: torture. It's so damn obvious. The corrections departments also try to destroy the bodies before autopsies, to hide the torture.

But I do think that line of what middle class is keeps getting pushed back further and further.

I don't know of any first time homebuyers that bought a brand new home (unless of course theyre very wealthy, which aren't the types we're talking about). New and expensive homes are reserved for people who have the money to buy them... many of which who've spent years building equity. There are older affordable homes all over the usa. I'm in Northern Illinois west of Chicago. There are move in ready homes in towns all around me that are selling for less than $125k. Sure, it's not downtown Chicago, it's not LA, it's not Boulder, it's not Manhattan. It isn't glamorous and it won't make you feel warm and fuzzy like you're rich, but they are solid and sealed homes with plumbing, heat and air, and most importantly affordable.  




You don't need a new car. Hell, you don't even need a car loan. If you want to buy a house, spending thousands more than what a car is worth just so you can have something fancy is not money smart. Right now, I'm driving a 05 Subaru Forester with almost 300,000 miles. For work, I regularly drive 100 miles per day. I have all the faith in this car. I've had it for more than a year and have had zero unexpected issues. You can purchase a similar car in most markets for a couple thousand dollars. It doesn't have heated seats or heated steering wheel. It doesn't have the greatest stereo. It doesn't look like a new KIA (but will run longer). It isn't fast. But, it's reliable and gets good fuel mileage. The amount of young people I've met these last few years that complain they'll never own a home, yet owe tens of thousands on a car, is astonishing. A car loan is just throwing away your money and if you don't have much, it's nothing more than a flashy anchor.


No new jobs? Between the last 3 months, weren't there something like 600,000 jobs added to the market? There are decent paying jobs out there. Maybe it isn't exactly what you want to do. Maybe it's not glamorous. Maybe it's boring. But if it pays your bills and allows you to live a life outside is work, who cares? I'm in construction. It's dirty. It's loud. It's dangerous. It's either very hot and humid or very cold. I'm not a big fan of the work and it's no passion of mine. But, it pays me very well and affords me great benefits. It allows me to spend life outside of work however I want to spend it.


Sometimes in life, you have to sacrifice a want for a need. Nothing is perfect. I get it, 30 years ago, life was different. Many of you think it was easier. But, we don't live 30 years ago. We live today. It sucks, but you might not get everything you want out of life. But, do your best to do your best and you'll most likely do better than those that don't.  


Ok, rant over. Let's get those downvotes coming in as well as those comments complaining about how used cars are supposedly unreliable and how you *should* be able to afford a home in LA working at Starbucks.","17","F"

I agree. But, that doesn't mean all of those jobs are only in HCOL areas. Just like how there are affordable homes *not* in HCOL areas, there are decent paying jobs not in HCOL areas. From facilities maintenance, to construction, to HR, to janitorial, to factory or manufacturing work... there are good paying jobs out there, it's just many people don't want those jobs for whatever


Yes, there are unreliable used cars out there. Some people do get unlucky (but why are we pointing that out? You could do everything right and still fail. Pointing out people *can* be unlucky is a defeatest attitude and part of the problem i am addressing). There are also unreliable brand new cars out there. Anybody can educate themselves on which cars to look for and which cars to stay away from. That info is free and accessible on the internet. There's also a plethora of information on how cars work and how to buy a used car, what to look for and what problems exist. Considering the expense that vehicles are, it's a topic anybody would do well to educate themselves on. 


I think one of the main problems facing young people today is mixed properties. People are prioritizing a pretty car over a good car. They're prioritizing what they want to do for work, over what pays the bills. They're prioritizing the fancy new thing over the thing they already own that still works. They're prioritizing a HCOL area over what makes financial sense. 


I also think there's an issue of attitude. We are in a temporary economy. It changes constantly with time. Yet, people are absolutely convinced they'll *never* be able to own a home or retire, then spend their money like those things are never going to happen. It's only a matter of time before markets turn around for the better like they have multiple times in my and my parents lives. But, if you continue to prioritize your money on things you don't need (like a new car over a used car), then you really never will be able to afford a home or retire. The market will turn back around and those that are planning for it today will be the ones to capitalize when the time is right. 


While I agree with everything you've stated, I don't believe any of it points to anything wrong with my original statements.


My advice for anybody worried is to plan ahead. Take good care of your credit. Balance your budget the best you can and save as much as humanly possible, even if it's $25 per paycheck or whatever. There are first time home buyer programs that allow for as little as 2% down and closing costs can be negotiated. If you're ready when prices and rates come down, you'll be able to buy a home. ","17_1_1","F"

There's an entire subclass of troll on Reddit that makes a game of baiting you into saying something that'll get you banned on a subreddit.

You're dropping a *lot* of right wing talking points. Ones you have to be pretty deep down the rabbit hole to know about. 

A lot of that stuff touches on some really, really nasty things that you're not far enough down the hole to have been taken over by yet. e.g. Genocide of trans and LGBTQ+ people, Christian Nationalism and extremism, and fascism in general.

I know you don't wanna hear this, but you were most likely banned not because you were being baited, but because you've made your entire personality ""extreme right wing politics"", likely without even realizing it, and general sci fi forums can't have guys like you around because [you turn them into a Nazi Bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/hsiisw/kicking_a_nazi_out_as_soon_as_they_walk_in/).

Please provide proof of this ""You're dropping a lot of right wing talking points."" theory of yours. So pointing things out is now right wing? 

Pointing out how Star Trek is no longer Star Trek? Pointing out how Star Wars is no longer Star Wars? Is this now right wing? Acceptable to ban then claim things like ""Genocide of trans and LGBTQ+ people, Christian Nationalism and extremism, and fascism in general.""? 

You say things like ""Genocide of trans people"" but what about the genocide of Grandchildren? Is it right wing to point out how grandchildren are being phased out with the ""message"" idealism? 

I know you don't want to think about possible negatives on subjects you deem most important (besides war, high cost of living, inflation etc), but What about the ""message"" talking points that are pushed beyond acceptable boundaries?

Rent is optional and not obligatory. If you want to get ahead and live in your car and use a PO box as an address, then do it. There are plenty of cheap housing in the... unsavory areas of the city, why not buy that house? If the city is just too expensive, why not move to a cheaper location? Nobody likes paying bills and paying the mortgage/rent but nobody is going to give you a free house to live in.","9_3_1_1_1_1_1","N"

Yes, CA's pretty progressive by American standards, but, and this is key, *they've still massively cut taxes on the 1% as compared to top tax rates from the 60s and 70s*.

The point is to make a trap. Everyone votes for tax cuts doing good times, when times change and we need to raise taxes on top earners we can't because of how the law is structured. 

It's exactly what I said it is, a trap. It's designed to create excuses to privatize public services so the 1% can profit off them.

And you get the cheapest flights by booking in advance and avoiding peak seasonal travel.

There's even a beach town near me that has restaurants that are 50% off everything in the off season. Which means normal prices (it's double in the summer).

The question is whether we compress the season into a day. Should it be cheaper to eat at a restaurant after the lunch rush?

Some cities have dynamic tolls that are higher during rush hour, for example.

Ultimately, I think it boils down to inequality. If you get the big bucks, you can do anything you want whenever you want. You can smoke in elevators. You can park literally anywhere any time. The fines are trivial for these things. But if society doesn't give you a high income, you can't do certain things at all and there are some things you can only do some of the time or during certain times.

Society wants to use dynamic pricing to thin the crowd and create a better experience for the richest people. But we've seen this play out a thousand times. The rich people are already on a hedonic treadmill and have achieved their max happiness. So taking services and activities from poor people to give them to rich people only makes happiness inequality worse. We are sacrificing the extensive margin (the extent to which poor people can do things) for the intensive margin (the intensity of rich people's experiences).","2","N"

If you remember Trump, following the Freedom Caucus dogma of privatizing any public agency, wanted to privatize the FAA, not realizing that congress has given the FAA sole authority over the airspace.  No state, municipal or any other federal agency laws or any regulations, supersedes the FAA.  They manage both the  civilian and military airspace and are the sole and final authority.

States With the Highest Average Salaries
Massachusetts: $76,600   
New York: $74,870    
California: $73,220   

The Region With the Highest Average Salary Is the Northeast 
Northeast: $65,383    
West: 60,579    
Midwest: $56,114   
South: $54,718   

2023:
Texas had an annual avg wage of $57,300, avg hourly wage of $27.55  

putting it well below many other (mostly northern/liberal) states.

https://calmatters.org/politics/capitol/2024/02/california-budget-deficit-balloons/

The reason for this is simple. High Tax places run off the business to low tax places, and those low tax, low regulation places end up making more money in the long run. This is called ""The Laffer Curve"" in Economics and it tells you the point where you raise taxes and regulation so high that it begin to negatively effect the economy.

&gt;If approved by parliament and the president, the legislation will allow almost 200,000 people employed in the sector to receive an additional 1,000 zloty (¬230) gross each per month starting from July. For those on the minimum wage, that would boost their earnings by almost 25%.

&gt;Social workers perform a difficult job that requires specialised knowledge and competences and they do so on a daily basis with full dedication and must be rewarded accordingly, said Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bk, the minister for family, labour and social policy.

&gt;

&gt;The measure will cover those working in the foster care and family support system, social care units  such as social assistance centres, crisis intervention centres and support centres  as well as childcare facilities for children up to the age of three  such as nurseries  that are run by local governments.

&gt;Over the last two years, I have very often met social workers in Polish local authorities. They are mainly women, with higher education, said Prime Minister Donald Tusk. He noted that they undertake very hard work but it is sometimes humiliating because they earn less than those they are helping.

&gt;He highlighted that an overwhelming majority are paid the [minimum wage](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/06/14/poland-plans-record-minimum-wage-rise/), which, as of January, stands at 4,242 zloty (¬980) per month. I insisted on preparing a solution for them, he added.

&gt;

&gt;The proposed bill would provide subsidies to local governments in order for them to make the extra payments to social care workers. Dziemianowicz-Bks ministry estimates that around 190,000 people working in the sector would be covered.

&gt;The bill will now be sent to parliament, where the government has a majority in both chambers. It must also then be signed by President Andrzej Duda, who is an opponent of the government but during his term in office has been supportive of measures to boost pay and social support.

&gt;I am counting on very quick work in parliament and a very quick signing by the president. I dont think he will be opportunistic here, Tusk added.

&gt;The policy announcement comes just over two weeks before local elections.","1","N"

norway and the UAE has a similar program but once the oil money runs out they will probably cut it because its a really expensive.

generally speaking, anything a government spends on its citizens should be considered an investment. so in terms of fiscal planning, a UBI would have to offer some kind of economic benefit in order to be sustainable.

So the way it worked and I have a very elderly friend from Poland when it was Commie and he told me, was everyone ""is an engineer"". Everyone was trained early on in math and engineering because the Soviets were in fact very serious about competing with the West, unlike the Chinese around the same time. Smart actually, I think starting everyone off on high level math and then you put the rest of them in whatever job they test out for. 

So the Soviets upon exiting school tested you and you could choose what sector you would like to go into, but basically they gave everyone a guaranteed job and an apartment in a ""Commie Block"". Everyone was paid the same, so a Doctor did not make much more money than say a Baker making bread. Also food was rationed, so on Sundays you had the ""meat day"" and you would wait in a long line for a cut of beef, but it was free, just like everything else because the State owned everything and everyone was an employee of the State. So on certain days, you had ""Razer Blade day"" and you stood in line for razors, soap, whatever, on whatever day. They were a nation of ""line waiters"", waiting around for their ration of whatever.

So when we move back to UBI, a trick the Soviets did was they hid their wealth from the public, ya know, the Biden and Trump types, the Uni-Party types, but there it truly was the Uni-Party and there was only one official State party, the Communists, just like China. The Politburo had special grocery stores for the party heads because they were the only left making any real money. Those stores had more items than the regular public were allowed to buy, but still short of what everyone in the West normally had access to on a daily, hourly basis, no line waiting either.

I think the problem that Economists are worried about, was the Soviet system fell apart and UBI today looks just like that system, so it is destined to fail. The biggest problem however with all ""Gift based systems"" is that anyone who wants a little more can ""side hustle"" and that person will have more than others and they will get jealous and start complaining to tax them more, the same things you see today from the Snowflake Socialist wannabe's here in the States.

This article explains what happened with the Soviets and groceries for instance.

The US led the world in entrepreneurship because it had a very high abundance of natural wealth in the commons anyone (white and male) could claim, and abundant access to markets to sell too. It is part of the US identity. UBI is an entrepreneurship power house because it recreates that basic access to a common wealth, so people don't have to go through established private wealth to become a producer. And instead can get bought out by some giant corporation as soon as they prove they have a decent idea or talent.

Also we have many problems like homelessness, drug abuse, obesity and other diseases of despair; that our default solutions to are mass incarceration and spiraling healthcare costs that generally only treat the symptoms of. UBI will get ahead of those problems and prevent them from taking hold, and make it easier for grass root solutions to take hold of people already suffering. It will be the topic of 2025 through till we enact it around 2030, assuming Biden wins. If Biden loses, could be a country in Europe or Africa. The Kenya UBI test is the biggest and longest to date, and has been very successful; it is totally possible a country over there passes one before 2030.","9","O"

A significant swath of Americans now expect to spend almost 40 years in retirement, with about 1 in 8 workers planning to stop working before they turn 61. At the same time, most workers say they want to live until they're 100. 

That means some workers are eyeballing a four-decade retirement, an ambitious goal that comes with serious downsides. Among them: How to fund almost 40 years of retirement at a time when most workers are far from reaching their savings goals. 

The findings, from a recent survey from financial services firm Corebridge Financial, underscore the gap between Americans' lofty dreams for their golden years versus their financial realities. The median retirement savings balance for people who are between 55 to 64  just years from potentially stepping back from work  is $185,000, according to NerdWallet.

""100 is a very long and fulfilling life, and that's pretty optimistic and great to see,"" Bryan Pinsky, president of individual retirement at Corebridge Financial, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""That optimism and hope does come with a little bit of tension  only 27% are very or extremely confident that they won't outlive their retirement savings.""

Lets remember, the Founding Fathers didn't want a direct tax on the people and as a result, the States paid the taxes for the Fed, mostly in trade tariffs and that was a whopping 2.5%. So the USA saw 10% growth year over year with those low low taxes and regulations. The day we started the income tax and the day the USA started to find itself in ""World Wars"" and from then on, we have been sending our money overseas to watch it go ""Poof"". 

So you sitting around wondering why they are bringing in cheap immigrants and giving them rooms that they should be giving to our homeless and treating them better. Its easy, its because you keep ""Gifting"" them the money and they spend it on what they want, and that's private jets, weapons and cheap labor to replace you. Get a clue already will ya? Remember, YOU PAY THOSE TAXES, NOT THE RICH. They hide if overseas in the same numbered accounts your Ukraine money is in right now.

This chart says it all. You pay all the taxes today, and its been set up to trickle down to you in all circumstances, so ANY tax increase at all, YOU PAY IT!

If the inflation wasn't justified by anything other than the desire for increased profits, then reducing those exploitative prices would be good for the  economy by allowing the money to be saved, which is supposedly a goal, or invested, another good goal, or diverted away  from corporate coffers into local businesses.

Aahh, there, I see the problem: corporate profits will shrink and the extremely wealthy will suffer emotional distress. we can't have that, of course, they are too emotionally fragile. Wage growth is out of the question as well, since that is inflationary, too.

The usual arguments against deflation concerns a lot of nonsensical crap about people putting off buying stuff because it will be cheaper in the future. That ignores the reality that a very great deal of what people buy is inelastic. Food, for instance. No one can put off buying food for a month in hopes that it will be cheaper then. they can't put off paying rent.

The ""deflation is bad argument"" is about luxury items, not everyday necessities. Just because some things might suffer reduced sales, the slack will be picked up elsewhere. The money not spent there will wind up being invested elsewhere, creating demand and jobs. Oh, I forgot, to fight inflation economists think that the best method is to destroy demand by destroying jobs, so people can't afford to buys stuff, and then prices won't rise so fast. Makes perfect sense, right? Also, ""invested elsewhere"" means competition and no good capitalist wants that.

Food prices could easily be restored to pre-pandemic levels without hurting the economy, and corporations could be satisfied with less than record profits year after year. Deflation isn't the bad thing capitalist economists try to make out it is.","13_1_1","O"

I think any comparison that ignores mortgage interest rates is missing something important.


In 1985 the average mortgage rate was 13%.  Assuming you financed the entire 83k average home price that means your monthly payment would have been around 900, which works out to about 47% of the stated annual income.


Assuming a 30 year at 7% in 2022 for the full median home price we get a payment of around 3k which works out to about 50% of the median income.


So, not that I'm on the side of boomers at all on this shit, but in a sense it is not that far off.  47% vs 50%.  You can definitely say homes are more expensive now, but it's hard to make the argument that it's all that drastic.


Things that a better analysis would consider is whether the median is a great measure in all cases here.  I imagine the distribution of home values and incomes looks a bit different now than it did in 85.  I would also like to know how property taxes, fees, insurance, and other costs of ownership factor in.  I have been in the market recently and we definitely have an affordability issue, but I'm not sure that this simple plot really provides much in understanding it.  Once you take mortgage rates into account it looks more or less on trend to me.","1_1_1","N"

&gt;One of the main problems with selling housing deregulation is the perception that new construction only benefits the rich.  Rich developers of course, but also rich home-buyers.  Its easy to see where casual observers get this idea.  New housing is usually nice housing, because over time technology improves and capital depreciates.  Since richer people are more willing to pay the upcharge for nicer housing, the future residents of new construction are usually well-to-do.

&gt;So what do casual observers miss?  They miss the big picture: People who move into new construction are moving away from older construction.  When they move, those older units become available for others.  While those others probably wont be drastically poorer than those they replace, they tend to be slightly poorer.  Think: one rung down.  When these slightly poorer people move, their prior dwellings will tend to be taken over by those who are a further rung down.  And so on, in a great chain reaction.  Allowing new construction really does help the whole income distribution.","2_1_5","N"

Metro Boston is a great proxy because there are like a million tiny towns are the more politically moderate ones like Everett build a lot more housing that the outwardly progressive ones like Brookline or Cambridge.

So the comparable  median income is $56,688 and the median home price would be $199,680.  So the  houses back then cost about 3.5 times annual salary. 
Now consider that the median home size in 1985 was 1,650 square feet.

Also, Im not sure why theyre using median instead of average.  The average home price in 2022 was only $348,000, not $468,000.  Also, home prices have already dropped significantly from their 2022 high. The 2023 median home price was only $417,700. 

The median home size in 2022 is 2,522 square feet, which is $165 per square foot. So if you were to buy a house in 2023 that was built in 2022, and was the same size as the houses in 1985, it would cost $272,500.  Or about 3.65 times your annual salary. 
So - almost no real difference from the situation in 1985.

I think the rest of your points are valid. The reason why median is used instead of average is because high home prices can introduce a bias that would inflate the average.


For example, if you have 5 homes: $250,000, $300,000, $350,000, $400,000, and $2.5M your average would be inflated to $770,000 which is nearly double the amount of 4 out of 5 homes. The median would be $350,000, which more accurately reflects the realistic prices expected for 4 out of 5 of those families who owned those homes.","18_2","I"

U.S. population in 2024: 342 million

Mechanization and trade has revolutionized U.S. food production, so agricultural workers now make up less than 2% of the U.S. worker population, compared to rough half in 1900. (This is why less than 1 in 10 illegal immigrant workers even toil in agriculture.) More and more rural small towns continue to empty out due to lack of job and other opportunities.

Automation and offshoring and trade means less than 8% of U.S. workers sweat it out in manufacturing, as opposed to the peak back in the late 1970s. Thousands of small factory towns across America have been hollowed out.

Computerization, offshoring, and AI means less and less need for knowledge workers. The peak was around the year 2000. And yet even though perhaps 1 in 10 adult Americans had a bachelors degree were higher back in the 1970s, 1 in 3 do now, and amongst Millennials it is roughly 1 in 2. This is why a significant portion of college graduates are working at jobs that do not require college degree at all.

The vast majority (over 90%) of net new jobs created in the U.S. over the past 20+ years have been of the kinds that are part time, temporary, lower paid, few oe no benefits, gigs or apps-based.

The overall trend is, fewer and fewer good paying jobs and exponentially explosive population growth - whether through reproduction, people living and working longer, or immigration (both legal and illegal).

Some clueless people proclaim that the United States is a very large country and there is lots of space. But all the jobs and desirable housing or concentrated.

That kind of concentration means intense competition for jobs and intense competition for housing.

When labor is scarce, wages rise, better benefits are offered, full time positions are offered.

When labor supply is oversaturated, employers (buyers or labor) can offer lower wages, offer fewer benefits, etc.

This is true in the overall labor market, and for specific skill sets. I remember even back in the 1990s, college graduates with.degrees in library science, biology, and English were struggling for jobs in their fields, though at least they could find some decent jobs. But theres also goes for manufacturing work, warehouse work, transportation, hospitality, food service, groundskeeping and maintenance, etc.

The current classic example is ride sharing and delivery apps. Youve got everyone competing: seniors, college students and college graduates, high school graduates and high school dropouts, single parents and stay-at-home parents, immigrants (legal and illegal with fake IDs), etc.

Same with housing. You wonder how people can afford housing? Many young adults are living with parents are combining money as roommates to bid on housing. When I was last renting in Southern California, we had upstairs neighbors who were three young women, each with their respective boyfriends. before that, in a condo I was renting there were 3 immigrant families occupying the 3-bedroom condo next to us, and on thr other side, 2 families occupied a 2-bedroom unit. The math is simple: 1 or 2 working adults are not going to have an easy time competing for housing against 6 adults earning even if thr 6 each earn less money.

Its all about supply and demand and all about math.

If you want to see the situation get worse, which is what anyone can predict will continue to happen, just continue our current policies.","23","N"

People do not need granite or quartz countertops. Formica is affordable, looks fine, and was common per 2005.

You do not need custom made old growth cabinets. 

Linoleum flooring will need to return to some extent in favor of wood or tile.

Glass shower enclosures will need to vanish in favor of good old fashion shower curtains.

Appliances will have to be more generic.

Basements (where they exist) will need to be unfinished.

You probably will have to settle for cheap builder grade fixtures as well rather than brushed steel or oil rubbed bronze.

Ceiling fans will need to be plain Jane basic where they are included at all.

These are All things homeowners can upgrade themselves over time. The instant gratification has to end.

We all say we want starter homes. Then builders make them and every single home is upgraded to the hilt. 

This has happened in two sub 300k new build neighborhoods in KC in the past five years. The models and choices were priced from 225 on up.
Not one actually sold for below 300k and many are now pushing 400k due to upgrades&. All of which are change orders and are marked up significantly beyond what they would be as standard options.

Trust me when I say these are NOT worth 400k. 

For that starting price you get an extra 1000+sqft, larger lots and homes that are standard with all the highly marked up upgrades, plus more. (Walk-in closets, wood floors, fireplaces, zones heating/cooling, custom fixtures, a huge appliance allowance, and guest rooms that are larger than most master bedrooms.

Starter homes were, well, small. like 800-1000 square foot small. Their lots were also much smaller. Like 3,000-4,000 square feet. You want to swap between quartz to formica? Wow you saved like 700 dollars on a 300-400k house. And the only issue is it's not as durable and not nearly as nice looking in quite literally the most important area of the entire house (based on consumer preferences). Cabinets are expensive as hell if they're real hardwood, but virtually no homes being built as part of developments are putting in maple cabinets. 

If you want to save money the single biggest thing is reducing square footage and depending on market, lot size. T**he biggest cost is not materials, but labor.** Cheaping out on materials generally does not result in significant savings.

  
Basically you can make a 2500 square foot house no one wants to live in  (formica, cheap carpet etc.) for 90% of the cost of a new 2,500 square foot house with nice finishes, or you make a 1,500 square foot house with identical finishes for 70% of the cost. Builders overstate the upgrade cost because they want to be able to say ""starting in the 250s"" or whatever, but know no one actually is going to build the base house. We almost bought a new build and if we had it was actually cheaper to buy the house with the ultra cheap carpet and pay someone else to dispose of it and replace it with hardwood for the price they wanted LVP. The actual upgrades are like 60% of the cost lennar etc. wants.

There are a few new build smaller houses being built around the country, but most people when faced with high housing cost just commute more from a worse area, or buy a crappy house and save up until they can remodel it.","1_3_1_1_1_1_1","I"

Just a reminder: none of the charming main streets and downtowns that everyone loves could have been built under current zoning laws.

The underdevelopment in the 2010's was the much bigger cause. Developers got burned hard in 2007-2008, so most pulled back on development.

This would have caused demand to go up (because of cheap financing), but this would also cause a substantial spur in development of new houses. The supply would rise to match the demand.

President Joe Biden this week said he has a plan to build 2 million new homes, part of his efforts to increase the supply of houses in the market which he believes is key towards improving affordability.

Prospective homeowners have struggled to afford getting into the housing market amid record-high mortgage rates and high prices. A limited supply of houses has led to increased competition which has led to increased buying costs.

&gt;1) Increases in housing supply slow the growth in rents in the region; 2) In some circumstances, new construction also reduces rents or rent growth in the surrounding area; 3) The chains of moves sparked by new construction free up apartments that are then rented (or retained) by households across the income spectrum; 4) While new supply is associated with gentrification, it has not been shown to cause significant displacement of lower income households; and 5) Easing land use restrictions, at least on a broad scale and in ways that change binding constraints on development, generally leads to more new housing over time, but only a fraction of the new capacity created because many other factors constrain the pace of new development.

In summary, remove supply side constraints -&gt; lower prices. Its pretty simple supply and demand, and frankly its a little weird that we seem to need studies to show us that; nevertheless, here we are.

Also worth noting, while its popular (and probably politically smart) to talk about corporate ownership of housing, [the reality is it really just doesn't matter that much](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4480261). Like, its probably worth throwing something like that in, because people will really love it and it will help the politics of the situation (you will hurt renters a little and cause some gentrification, but those effects seem marginal compared to the positive politics). But, you should pair it with something that's actually helpful for the problem.","11","I"

According to this article, my information was indeed wrong, EVs do offset more than ICEs fuel consumption, even considering production of it. However, the problem here is that simply offsetting what ICE cars would consume still means that you are polluting, and our environment is already collapsing, so building billions of EVs to phase out ICE cars would create more problems, it would not solve the problem.

&gt;The capitalism system is merely an economic method to trade goods and services efficiently, it doesn't control or push for more production. The human condition and societal demands do. 

That is completely incorrect. The capitalist system demands growth, because without growth there is crisis.

For example, recessions are simply a slow down of growth, and that already creates massive problems for our society, imagine what negative growth would look like in a capitalist system. Normally negative growth only happens after catastrophes, like wars, or extreme climatic events.

We lower demand by creating collective alternatives to individual products.

If I have say $10 to spend on a toothpaste, I might opt to buy it from a large publicly-traded company. I can own a share of the company to benefit from the profit, the finance of the company is at least more transparent. The tooth paste likely is more tightly regulated, has better quality control, and probably lower cost. The large company likely hire qualified scientist/engineer to ensure the good quality of the toothpaste, and good accountant/specialist to comply with the necessary regulation. Whereas if I buy it from a small family business, it may be more expensive, with worse quality control. The profit likely goes largely to the owner, his/her sons or daughters, or the few cousins they employ.  The employee who actually makes the toothpaste probably got paid less than if he works at bigger corporations.

Here is another look, OP (/u/obamascrocss):

U.S. population in 1970: 295 million  
U.S. population in 2024: 342 million

Mechanization and trade has revolutionized U.S. food production, so agricultural workers now make up less than 2% of the U.S. worker population, compared to rough half in 1900. (This is why less than 1 in 10 illegal immigrant workers even toil in agriculture.) More and more rural small towns continue to empty out due to lack of job and other opportunities.

Automation and offshoring and trade means less than 8% of U.S. workers sweat it out in manufacturing, as opposed to the peak back in the late 1970s. Thousands of small factory towns across America have been hollowed out.

Computerization, offshoring, and AI means less and less need for knowledge workers. The peak was around the year 2000. And yet even though perhaps 1 in 10 adult Americans had a bachelors degree were higher back in the 1970s, 1 in 3 do now, and amongst Millennials it is roughly 1 in 2. This is why a significant portion of college graduates are working at jobs that do not require college degree at all.

The vast majority (over 90%) of net new jobs created in the U.S. over the past 20+ years have been of the kinds that are part time, temporary, lower paid, few oe no benefits, gigs or apps-based.

The overall trend is, fewer and fewer good paying jobs and exponentially explosive population growth - whether through reproduction, people living and working longer, or immigration (both legal and illegal).

Some clueless people proclaim that the United States is a very large country and there is lots of space. But all the jobs and desirable housing or concentrated.

That kind of concentration means intense competition for jobs and intense competition for housing.

When labor is scarce, wages rise, better benefits are offered, full time positions are offered.

When labor supply is oversaturated, employers (buyers or labor) can offer lower wages, offer fewer benefits, etc.

This is true in the overall labor market, and for specific skill sets. I remember even back in the 1990s, college graduates with.degrees in library science, biology, and English were struggling for jobs in their fields, though at least they could find some decent jobs. But theres also goes for manufacturing work, warehouse work, transportation, hospitality, food service, groundskeeping and maintenance, etc.

The current classic example is ride sharing and delivery apps. Youve got everyone competing: seniors, college students and college graduates, high school graduates and high school dropouts, single parents and stay-at-home parents, immigrants (legal and illegal with fake IDs), etc.

Same with housing. You wonder how people can afford housing? Many young adults are living with parents are combining money as roommates to bid on housing. When I was last renting in Southern California, we had upstairs neighbors who were three young women, each with their respective boyfriends. before that, in a condo I was renting there were 3 immigrant families occupying the 3-bedroom condo next to us, and on thr other side, 2 families occupied a 2-bedroom unit. The math is simple: 1 or 2 working adults are not going to have an easy time competing for housing against 6 adults earning even if thr 6 each earn less money.

Its all about supply and demand and all about math.

If you want to see the situation get worse, which is what anyone can predict will continue to happen, just continue our current policies.","1_1","I"

Central to the American ethos is the notion of a thriving middle class as the cornerstone of the American dream. This dream envisions that anyone armed with a high school diploma and a strong work ethic could effortlessly attain a comfortable lifestylea nice suburban home, two cars, and an annual family vacation to a desirable destination. Many Americans view this as an inherent entitlement, believing that such prosperity has always been the norm and a divine right.



However, the reality of an exceedingly affluent middle class, surpassing global standards, is not the typical course of events. It is instead a consequence of unique historical circumstances, particularly the aftermath of World War II. Following the war, the United States emerged as the sole major industrial power with its industry and infrastructure largely unscathed. This bestowed upon the US a significant economic advantage, as other nations relied heavily on American goods and services.



In the post-World War II era, businesses worldwide had little choice but to purchase American products for their needs, driving capital flow into American enterprises. However, this prosperity was also facilitated by concessions made to labor unions due to the scarcity of highly skilled American workers, leading to remarkable growth and affluence in the US middle class during the 1950s and 1960s.



Over time, however, other industrial powers recovered and began challenging American dominance in the global market. Competition intensified as countries such as Germany, Japan, Belgium, Britain, the Netherlands, France, and others entered the fray. Additionally, newly industrialized nations like Brazil, South Africa, India, China, Mexico, Thailand, Turkey, South Korea, and more began vying for resources to fuel their own growth, altering the dynamics of global trade.



Consequently, the once-exclusive advantage of the American workforce diminished as other nations developed comparable capabilities, eroding the bargaining power of American workers and labor unions. Moreover, globalization enabled manufacturers to engage in global wage arbitrage by relocating production to countries with cheaper labor, further weakening the position of American workers.



The unsustainable nature of the American middle-class lifestyle, characterized by high consumption and resource demands, became apparent. Earth's resources are finite, and if global consumption mirrored that of the average American, it would exceed the planet's capacity by multiple folds.



The decline of the US middle class stems from these structural shifts in the global economy, and political solutions cannot reverse the course of globalization. The notion of returning to the ""good old days"" is a fallacy perpetuated by politicians on both sides of the aisle.



Moving forward, the American middle class will likely resemble its counterparts worldwide, necessitating adjustments in expectations and lifestyles. While inequality remains a pressing issue, efforts toward wealth redistribution should focus on areas such as healthcare affordability and urban livability rather than attempts to revive an outdated version of the middle class lifestyle. Embracing a model akin to other countries' middle classes, coupled with robust social services and safety nets, offers a more realistic path forward.","5","I"

Imagine feeding a massive, fat, pig, everyone working hard, harvesting and tending to that fat ass pig.  Then you have carry that fat as pig around, and then their fat ass piglets till they too become massive fat ass bloated hogs.  It takes a lot of sacrifice and effort to do that.  You are doing that.  Except now the pigs you carry live in mansions, have golden retirement plans, 100% health care, beach condos and mountain lodges, Ivy League schools and luxury cars, all while traveling freely around the world and living socialite lives where they blather on and on at the country club, golfing range, and bumping elbows with superstars.  It's a life you will never know, but one that you definitely support through your daily grind and struggling sacrifices.

In December 2023, the latest data made available by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), California had 830,000 job openings. While higher month-over-monthwith 751,000 openings the month beforethe number was much lower than a year prior, when it stood at 1,244,000 in December 2022.

Homes, stocks, cars, food, gas, etc.  The winners were the ones who owned those things that went up (rich Boomers) and the losers (poor Millennials and Gen-Z) were the ones who were forced to buy those things with ever weaker dollars.

If we treated the pandemic like WW2, we would have asked citizens to choose austerity until the crisis was over which would have cost less and allowed spending to return back to normal.

Instead, we've normalized that level of spending (current spending is 50% more than 2019 even though crisis is over) and guaranteed cost of living to continue to remain high and go higher over time.","4","O"

Lottery shops in China are ditching bland storefronts to reinvent themselves as hipster hangouts, with slogans that tempt youngsters hit by an economic slowdown with the lure of getting rich quick.

We should still have dreams, who knows one day they may come true? reads one sign at one lottery store in Chongqing, in southwestern China. With sleek outside seating styled like a trendy cafe, its tagline is more than just a lottery shop.

Another Lotto Coffee store in Kunming, capital of the southwestern province of Yunnan, promised a free scratch ticket with every coffee purchase. A cup of coffee with good luck, said a slogan on the wall. Sales of scratch-offs, which offer instant results, last year were the highest in data going back to 2008, official statistics show.

The problem is that with free money people can begin a bidding cycle of accumulation. Imagine for a moment everybody gets 10 USD's because that is what you need to live. Somebody being clever says, ""hey I don't mind eating less and wearing paper clothes so I will use my monies to buy something I really want.""  What they really want they are willing to bid up for. The person who sells the really want can say, ""hey let me increase the price"".  Thus the seller gets more money, and now can start their own accumulation of out bidding the other person.

If you were to give more and more and more free money then you will keep increasing the quantity and increasing the prices because people will keep out bidding each other.

You could argue, ""stop that you don't do that, the state will say this is X, and this is Y.""  What you just created is communism. Communism is not where everyone is equal, but you give all that you can and only take what you need. In essence it is the theory of Jesus. I am not kidding here. You remove the idea of bidding and accumulation. You give everything what people want.

Ok the problem... You give everything what people want. The problem is that people are greedy and people want power. Thus communism does not work. I don't know how much you know about Star Trek, but Star Trek is the communist ideal. Ferengis are who we are today. In Star Trek there is no money, there is never talk about power and accumulation. There is talk about adventure and bettering your own person. 

The fact that you feel bad is good, and IMO you are the right person for the job. Somebody who would be comfortable doing your job and having no problem taking money from poor people is the problem of our society.  So two thumbs up for asking the question... I think you are a good person.","2","I"

The U.S. budget is not equivalent to a household budget. The world runs on dollars and if you are the government that issues dollars, you get to do what you want. Military spending is 3.5% of GDP. Our military spending is far higher than everyone else; so is the size of our economy. This is why we get to do what we want.

Never mind whether this is good or bad or should/shouldn't and all that. If you're on top, you do what you can to stay on top. A shit-ton of national debt is kind of a shrug when you get to do what you want; if you're not on top, you'll have issues, so stay on top.

With that out of the way - why don't we spend money on people in ways that would not only save everyone money (including the government), but actually make the economy even stronger? Well we used to do more of it... but it's basically due to increasingly powerful private individuals and organizations looking at the loss of revenue that would result if we did set up single payer healthcare or free college. Over the decades there have been many government sponsored programs that have slowly been transitioned to private business interests. We've been told it was to save noney on the deficit or to make things more efficient or (my favorite) give consumers more choices to save money.

That's it - we spend what we do and where we do to remain #1. We don't spend on things to help more people because that would result in lower profit margins for the S&amp;P 500.","4","I"

The efficiency of that funding may be greater than, sadly, a smaller population of cancer victims. 

The printing of more money can devalue the dollar due to inflationary response of doing so...  so it's actually important to ensure taxation and proper debt balancing with credit-worthy bodies. I thought we could just print infiniteomey too, and I don't think the good provided would actually devalue the dollar enough for those who are in need. 

My guess, right now, is that EU and Middle East feel unstable, and US is a great exporter of military goods and services, so our government leans on that to debt finance our allies (and likely our enemies too). Depending on the credit worthiness of those countries, the US stands to increase the value of its dollar, or to gain in interest from those countries. I'm not sure I know how to explain this well enough...

Whereas there is no direct benefit to debt financing those who need the charity money - they likely aren't credit worthy enough... It's sad, but true. 

With the last statement -- but just to caveat that I'm still figuring out how to explain this myself and may over  generalize here -- crony capitalism plays into this... While some may say the standard of living has or is getting better more broadly (this may be challenged more recently), lack of progressive tax policy is leaving behind the lower and middle classes due to the response (inflation) of printing too much money, and that money being in the hands of the ultra wealthy to invest in things that will continue to increase profit. Where do the needy fit into this equation? The answer: they don't...

So charities are there as an 'altruistic' tax, not enforced by government policy, but perhaps beneficial with tax credits for some. 

I would be interested to see the correlation of charity $ volume during more versus less wealth inequality in the US. 

If your charity serves people in other countries, then that may just be another channel for supplying aid... In a way, it's through a tax system, not just simply printing money. If it is through printing money and sending it across, there should be some deal to pay it back (and generally serving needy populations can pay back if the government of the needy is not corrupt). In the case where debt cannot be paid back, political conflict can errupt. Jeffrey Sachs describes this in ""The End of Poverty"".

The government could create (""print"") £¬$100 Trillion tomorrow and leave it in a bank account, and the currency would not depreciate against real goods and services because the mechanism for price rises comes from people outbidding each other for scarce supply (i.e. actual attempts at spending it).

1) We don't print money to fund the military. We print money to pay for deficit spending which is ALL government spending that is more than revenue. Some of it is military, some is Food Stamps, some funds the Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (to the tune of $500 Million) and other useless spending. 

2) It would be nice if we could just print money to pay for all the things we want but printed money causes inflation and I think we all agree that we don't like inflation.

3) We do have a resource problem. There is a finite amount of income we can tax and the history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business and invest it in tax-exempt securities or to find other lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income.

In the United States, life expectancy has shockingly dropped recently.  Lower life expectancy has a lot to do with the current health system and inequity in our country, but I digress.  

I can assure you many people do not, or cannot work, into their 70s, depending on a number of factors such as the type of work and someones health and cognition.  

Republicans and Democrats plans to stabilize Social Security and Medicare could not be farther apart.  For concrete or analytical thinkers, especially those who are younger, and may not appreciate the level of energy it takes to work past a certain age, Republicans plan seems good.  Just raise the retirement age or, as Senator Rick Scott proposed, just sunset Medicare and Social Security if they dont get the votes.  Keep giving corporations large tax cuts and cut funding to the IRS that is going after wealthy tax cheats and, in their words, all will be good.  This, of course, is not a serious plan for the American people.

Corporations received an enormous tax break in 2017. While their profits soared, their investment in their workers did not.  Their shareholders and top executives reaped the benefits without the promised trickle down.

President Bidens Fiscal Year 2025 Budget would set the corporate tax rate at 28 percent, still well below the 35 percent rate prior to the 2017 tax law.  

President Bidens Budget also includes a 25% minimum tax on the wealthiest 0.01 percent.  Already, the IRS has collected more than $500 million in unpaid taxes and launched enforcement action against 25,000 millionaires who have not filed a tax return since 2017.  

It is shocking that anyone would oppose making corporations and millionaires pay their fair share to help reduce the federal deficit and stabilize safety nets that Americans have paid into for decades. Any effort to push the Social Security age to an age closer to the end of life expectancy, or to sunset safety nets, is a theft of the American people who have paid into these systems for decades.","4","I"

Forgiveness was always a device to drive younger voters to the voting booth and get excited about a Biden/Harris ticket. They had nothing to lose and everything to gain by promising the golden goose, and just like how Dems chose to never legislate Abortion and remain satisfied with Roe for 50 years, the voterbase is either too blind or too complacent to hold their party accountable for grifting them for votes and getting little to nothing in return.","1_1_1_1_1_1","I"

Don't get me wrong, Higher Ed is a racket. I used to work in financial aid for colleges and that entire system is in desperate need of sweeping reform. My point is simply that the Biden campaign, in a very astute political calculation, used forgiveness to get the gullible and the desperate excited enough to go to the polls and vote for one of the most unappealing candidates in anyone's memory to beat Trump. There was no downside or risk for them to do it.

They would have tried to formally legislate it instead of trying to stand up a creative interpretation of law by executive order in front of a conservative court that everyone knew was going to be very conservative. Or maybe they could have tried something with stimulus payments, or somehow nationalized the debt, perhaps by purchasing it back. There were several avenues.

I don't know about counting on it failing, I think the nuance is that they had nothing to lose and everything to gain. In other words, the Biden campaign was playing ""heads I win, tails you lose."" Think about it. If it works, you fulfilled a promise. If it doesn't, you can say it would have worked if not for the Republicans, and everyone should vote Blue if they want to try again.

Student loan forgiveness for a select few is not a solution. It's a bandaid, and it's a political move.

That is part of the problem, yes, but it's not a 1:1 problem.  What is worth the tradeoff, however, is that the loans make college accessible to families that could otherwise not afford it.  Education also has inherent worth.  We need a more educated population especially to compete in the international economy.  This is a case of the cure for the disease not being to kill the patient.

Your bit about Biden is partisan rhetoric that is often repeated.  First of all, the loan forgiveness here is a policy that's been in place for over a decade now. The forgiveness comes if you work in the public sector for 10+ years of making regular payments on your loan. So it's not a new policy, it's that people are finally hitting the 10 year mark. Public sector workers take the lower paying job counting this as a benefit.

Second, it is a legitimate crisis.  Many young people can't afford to have children (especially without government aid that is less than sufficient on top of everything) or get a house to grow their net worth, etc.  We're facing a birth rate problem.  It's making the economy inaccessible to them.  The loans are predatory in their terms and conditions and designed to be a debt trap that you can't get out of from bankruptcy unlike other debt.","1_2_1_2_1","I"

***No such right exists.***

We need to set a cap on wealth accumulation. Wealth inequality feeds upon itself and is destructive of democracies and free societies, because no matter how big you ""grow the pie"", the superwealthy will always want more of it, and through the power their wealth gives them, they will *take* it. Any economist who claims that wealth distribution is not zero-sum is a liar. Anyone who believes that lie is a deluded fool.

&gt;In 2022, Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla and SpaceX, was ranked first in the billionaires list published by the US business magazine Forbes. Suppose you worked 50 hours a week between the ages of 20 and 65  week in week out, year in year out  how much would your hourly wage need to be so that by the end you had amassed Musks wealth? The answer is: $1,871,794 per hour. Almost two million dollars per hour. Every working hour for 45 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elon Musk might be seen as exceptional, but there were 2,668 other billionaires on that Forbes list. Together they held $12,700,000,000,000. Do you, like me, see all those zeros dancing before your eyes? Thats because we dont know how to take in that number. On average the value of their assets is $4.75bn. If we ask the same question again  whats the average lifetime hourly wage?  we get $40,598 per hour, the equivalent to what many Americans hope to earn in a year.

The part of your video that discusses what people pay in social security tax is misleading garbage.  The amount you pay in social security is capped because guess what?  The amount you get paid when you retire is also capped.  In fact, the amount you can get paid is capped so low, that people in the top 10% end up paying WAY more into social security than they can ever hope to get out from it.  More so, if they had just been allowed to keep their own money and invest it themselves for their own retirement, they would retire with MILLIONS more than they will ever be paid by social security.  So far from the cap being a windfall for rich people, social security is a massive drain on them.  In fact, it ends up that most top 10% earners could retire YEARS earlier if they weren't burdened with the government stealing their retirement money and giving it less successful people through the scam of social security.

EDIT:  I can't get over how stupid this social security issue is, so I have to continue:

Someone making $160,200 per year pays $9,945 per year into social security. Assuming they work 40 years, that means they pay $397,800 into social security.  They are capped at being paid $39,946 per year from social security after retirement at age 67.  Life expectancy is 77 years, so thats an average of 10 years, or $399,460.  So theyve made a whopping $1,660 on their investment.
  
Meanwhile, if they had been allowed to opt out of social security, and just invested that $9,945 in the S&amp;P 500 every year, it would have grown to $5,241,000 in that 40 years.  Whats that you say?  They dont need $5,000,000 to retire?  Well, thats not your call to make.  But heres the really horrific truth:  Lets say youre right.  What if they only want a million dollars to retire?  Well, they WOULD HAVE had that in only 24 years, if they would have been allowed to opt out of social security.  So, because they were FORCED to pay into social security, they had to work for an additional 16 years, and STILL not retire with millions!  Social security ruined their lives!
  
Meanwhile, someone who makes only $29,766 per year pays $2,277 annually into social security.  Over 40 years of employment, that comes to $91,084 paid in.  They can expect to collect $14,824 per year after retirement, which would be $140,824 over the ten years of their remaining life expectancy.  So they profit nearly $50,000 from social security.  You might think, See?  It benefits the poor!  No, it doesnt.  Because if they had just been allowed to keep their own damn money and invest it in the S&amp;P 500, they would have retired with $1,200,000 million!

Here, I'll give you an example in concrete numbers.  You probably think that social security is a good thing.  I'm going to show you how wrong you are:

Someone making $160,200 per year pays $9,945 per year into social security. Assuming they work 40 years, that means they pay $397,800 into social security.

What if they only want a million dollars to retire?  Well, they WOULD HAVE had that in only 24 years, if they would have been allowed to opt out of social security and invest that money in the market.  So, because they were FORCED to pay into social security, they had to work for an additional 16 years, and STILL not retire with millions!  Social security ruined their lives, and basically turned them into slaves for 16 years.
  
I can hear you saying, ""But social security benefits the POOR!""  Nope.   
 Someone who makes only $29,766 per year pays $2,277 annually into social security.  Over 40 years of employment, that comes to $91,084 paid in.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predistribution

The problem with the ""tax and redistribute"" solution to inequality/oppression is that the people who have grotesque amounts of wealth and power are able to not only prevent redistribution, but also to bludgeon everyone else into giving up everything else also.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uzc-5BQKz4

Another issue is, systemic corruption in our political system means that voters have essentially zero influence on public policy when their preferences conflict with those of our ruling oligarchs/kleptocrats.

We need to solve our systemic corruption problem before ""government"" will even be capable of taking on our ruling oligarchs/kleptocrats, who are obviously extremely well resourced.

https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2024/03/Symposium-Rethinking-Economics-Angus-Deaton 

By the time you get to questions of taxation, all the major resourcing and policy decisions have already been made.  

So taxing the rich as a standalone solution without looking at ""predistribution"" is kind of like coming in at the 9th inning when you're already down by 1000 runs and expecting to turn things around.  The game is already over at that point, but people just haven't realized it yet.

Which is part of why shortening the work week (which we should have done when women entered the paid labor force in meaningful numbers, doubling the paid labor supply) is so important - people need to have time to develop fully, and to participate in their communities and political processes in order to challenge the power of our ruling oligarchs/kleptocrats.

We could fix a lot of shit if there was a price attached to the value we destroy along the way, and if the bill for that, as the OP suggests, landed on the right desk, of course.

I'll guess that your ask is ""more affordable housing"" as we always hear. The noble things don't always pan out. What you're asking for is ""cheap"" housing. That inevitably brings in a demographic that does not enrich the local area. How many towns or investors want to be a part of that?

Timing, mainly.   [We're not going to build 7.2 million homes overnight](https://nypost.com/2024/02/28/real-estate/the-us-housing-supply-is-short-7-2-million-homes/). We're decades away from catching up to the point where we have enough houses, and if investors are buying up a huge percentage of them as they're being built, it's not helping individuals get into homes they own.

&gt;What you're asking for is ""cheap"" housing. That inevitably brings in a demographic that does not enrich the local area.

I don't think people realize what goes into rezoning.  Before they rezone to allow a whole lot more people, they have to make sure the area can sustain that amount of people.  And if it can't, they have to make all the upgrades to make it able to sustain that amount of people.

If a city's current regulations say they allow x units per square mile, the utilities are set up to anticipate x units per square mile.  If you increase it, you're going to have to sure up all of those utilities.  Otherwise you get brown-outs, clogged sewers, overwhelmed schools, water shortages, and insane traffic.

It's not that easy.  Changing zoning laws is complicated process that involves fighting doing environmental impact research, utility preparedness studies, traffic studies, parking studies, service analysis, and a whole pile of other things.

Basically, if they want to take an area where the average lot size is 1/4 acre and say ""you can now put 3 homes on a lot instead of 1"" they'll have to make sure the electrical grid can actually supply that many homes, that the sewage system can handle that many homes, that the schools won't be overcrowded, that there's enough firemen for the increase in structures, that there's enough police for the increase in population, that the roads won't be constant gridlock, that there will be parking, and that there's enough water in the area to support that number of homes. Hell even things like internet, if ISPs ran lines into an area in anticipation of 1,000 homes and now there's suddenly 2,000 homes, they're going to have problems.

So it's more than just scratching out a minimum lot size and writing a new number, they have to make sure that new number is sustainable, first.  So, yes, it can be done, but it's definitely not ""easy.""","1_2_2","I"

Traditional IRA saves you taxes today, Roth IRA saves you taxes at retirement - lots of younger people chose this option.  Start depositing whatever you can each week, invest it into that brokerage's S&amp;P 500 index fund.  That's all you gotta do.  If you are 18, $22/week will make you a millionaire. If you wait until 30 to start, you need $65/week. Age 40 needs $167/week (this exceeds the limit for an IRA, so some would have to be in a non-tax qualified account).

Some people will argue here with me that ""$1M is nothing today"".  I argue $1M sure is better than actually having nothing.  Taking out 5% annually at retirement is $50k, average social security is $20k, so you'd have $70k a year income at retirement instead of $20k, that sounds pretty damn good to me.

Of course, even better, if you start making that $22/week contribution at 18 and keep increasing your contribution each year, you'll have several million at retirement.  Like if you do $22/week starting at 18, add another $65/week starting at age 30, add another $167/week at age 40, you'll be at $3M at retirement.  Marry someone doing the same as you, and you'll have a $6M net worth, withdrawing 5%, you'd have $300,000 annual income during retirement.

There are now more than 5.5 million Americans with liquid investible assets of more than $1 million, up 62% over the past decade and well above the global growth rate of 38%, according to the [2024 USA Wealth Report](https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/usa-wealth-report-2024) from Henley &amp; Partners and New World Wealth.

In the past five years, the population of millionaires in the U.S. has grown 35%, nearly twice as fast as Chinas. The U.S. is now home to 37% of the worlds millionaires, up from 35% in 2018.

The divergence grows even more at the top of the wealth ladder. The U.S. has 9,850 centi-millionaires (those worth $100 million or more) compared with Chinas 2,352. The U.S. has about 788 billionaires to Chinas 305.

Well, the top five years in terms of real median income in the US have been the last five years. The highest earning generation is Gen-X. We're also near historically low unemployment and Gen-X has the lowest unemployment rate of any generation.

It kind of sounds like Gen-X right now has it better than any generation in history. Congrats, y'all are the new Baby Boomers. And yes, someday that will likely be true for Millennials and Gen-Z. That's how things usually work in a growing economy.

But if you were ever annoyed when Baby Boomers would complain about how hard they had it when they were provably the most spoiled generation in history, then you might want to ease off the gen-x pity party right now. Y'all have it better than literally every other age group and that will only continue as wealth continues to pass from the Boomers to you guys.

And yes, you might have personal examples of friends that are exceptions to the trends in economic data. A few datapoints among hundreds of millions isn't really worth mentioning though.","4_1_1","I"

Reddit's journey from a college dorm room idea to a publicly traded entity capped off with a $6.4 billion IPO on Thursday, cementing its place as the newest social media company to go public.

Yet, Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder whose early vision shaped Reddit, was not among the beneficiaries of the corporate milestone, or the financial windfall attached to it. Ohanian, conspicuously absent from the company's S-1 filing and not listed among those owning more than a 5 percent stake, had parted ways with his ownership after selling Reddit to Condé Nast in 2006.

For monopolists and the grotesquely wealthy, they win under both high interest rate and low (and negative) interest rate environments.

In high interest rate environments, they get paid enormously for sitting on their existing capital and doing nothing.

In low interest rate environments, they get paid by borrowing at extremely low rates (using their existing capital as collateral) in order to buy up additional assets cheaply.

It is the same exact reason that red states take in more federal subsidies than they return in tax revenue and blue states return more in tax revenues than they take in subsidies. 

Measuring subsidies alone, blue states take in more than red states. Yet when we measure the amount taken in compared to federal tax revenue paid out blue states end up with a much larger positive tax revenue balance so that excess ends up subsidizing red state social programs.  You might think it would be the opposite. 

https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2FeBuDrkIah9UKDtvsoHAnV4YTZZN1oXJaVGE6lVlDPIk.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D485d0bd0dae95fd484260666885290310f666dd1

The reason is that direct subsidies to people at the bottom create the greatest amount of wealth because increasing the spending power of wage earners is subject to the multiplier effect.  The same effect that makes fractional reserve banking possible. 

So for every dollar injected into the bottom of the economy you get more than $10 dollars in return.  This boost in consumption increases revenues, profits, and tax revenues and increases the GDP. 

Raising wages, helicopter money, living subsidies, govt financed projects that raise wages or create jobs for the bottom all have the same effect.  You get back more than you give. 

Subsidies that do not increase the spending power of the bottom directly have the opposite effect. For every dollar spent you get less in return. So subsidies that go to firms or banks with the thought that they will pass this on to the public do not get passed on to the public, so they do not increase the marginal propensity to consume. 

The same is true of the nordic model countries. They know that homelessness is a cost center that only increases in cost the longer a person is homeless. When I say cost, I mean a cost in taxes that are not collected as a result of less consumption. 

The more homelessness you have, the less consumption you have thus the less tax revenue you generate.

If we take into account lost productivity and the social costs associated with homelessness, the cost of allowing someone to become homeless far outpaces the cost in subsidies you spend to keep them from being homeless. 

This does not take into account that the poverty ""escape wage"" is much higher than the nominal wage to keep someone from being destitute. 

In the USA the poverty escape wage is about $35 per hour.  The wage to keep someone out of poverty is about $27.00 per hour.","1_1_1_2_1","I"

The USSR literally depopulated large portions of their most productive agricultural land, confiscated agricultural land and equipment, and then tried to implement both inapplicable crops AND farming techniques (using labor that wasn't even experienced with agriculture).

I make widgets. I want more profit. I don't want to do the hard work of reducing operation costs. My widget sells for $1.00. I now sell my widget for $2.00. I lose a couple customers, but not so much that I lose money. My profits increase by 20%. The customers purchasing power in relation to my widgets has halved. They can find other widgets, maybe, but those widgets will increase in price as they notice my strategy worked.

Inflation, way over simplified but I've seen this more or less in the real world and within my own company. We aren't charging more for any reason other than leadership demanded us to, despite no increase in our costs.

Over the years with all the tech advancements the average worker has been more productive vs 30-40years ago. For example, in engineering a computer aided design (CAD), can produce product design far quicker than hand drafting, from 3D/2D design to making edits. This in turn allowed companies to have more efficient design process allowing companies to produce more. It only makes sense with automation, tech advancements that the conversation of shortening the work week comes up.


HOWEVER, the American worker is in no position to try to leverage that right now. I fear corporations would retaliate by outsourcing labor to other countries. In addition to that, will there be any guarantee that income would stay the same and we wont be paid less working less hours?

Our ruling oligarchs/kleptocrats have already been outsourcing labor to other countries for years, and I would argue that the public is a lot more dangerous and aware of the situation now as compared to even 10 years ago.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) introduced legislation that would formalize a 32-hour workweek in the United States. This isnt the first time the topic has made it to the front of the news cycle, but its the latestand one of the most visibleattempts to institutionalize a shorter workweek in a way that goes beyond company policies.

I don't know how this works. Many Americans don't work 30 hours a week as it's considered full time and comes with benefits. I doubt salaried workers will be limited to 30 hours a week.

&gt;If passedan outcome that seems highly unlikely in todays Washington environment Sanders bill would lower the threshold for which workers are eligible to receive overtime pay and include a four-year transition period to the shorter week. The sad reality is that Americans now work more hours than the people of any other wealthy nation, Sanders said during a Thursday committee hearing.

Voter ID Laws: ALEC has been involved in drafting model legislation for stricter voter ID laws, aimed at reducing voter fraud. These laws have been sponsored by various legislators in different states. An example includes the voter ID law in Wisconsin, sponsored by state Representative Jeff Stone and state Senator Joe Leibham, with involvement from corporations like Koch Industries.  
Private Prison Legislation: ALEC has developed model bills that promote the use of private prisons. For instance, Arizona's SB 1070, a controversial immigration bill, was influenced by ALEC's model legislation. Corporations like Corrections Corporation of America (now CoreCivic), which operates private prisons, were involved in ALEC during this period. The bill was sponsored by state Senator Russell Pearce.  
Environmental Deregulation: ALEC has also been involved in creating model legislation that seeks to roll back environmental regulations. This includes bills that challenge the EPA's regulatory authority. Legislators in various states have introduced these bills, often with backing from energy companies like ExxonMobil and Peabody Energy.  
Telecommunications Legislation: ALEC's model bills have included legislation favoring telecommunications companies, like easing regulations for broadband and cable companies. An example is legislation related to municipal broadband, limiting the ability of cities to create their own broadband services in competition with private companies. Telecom companies like AT&amp;T and Comcast have been involved in these efforts.

US domestic oil production rose from 9K/day when Obama left office to 13K/day under Trump, just before COVID hit in 2020.

Then, COVID. And with COVID came lockdowns and demand for oil fell precipitously, along with production, but the production capacity had been built, under Trump.

Then, Biden took office in Jan 2021 and he made it clear on his first day that fossil fuels were a dead energy policy and the future was green. Investments drained from fossil fuels and into greener energies.

That was huge policy mistake and we all paid for it for the next 3 years with gasoline prices rising more than 100% as post-COVID demand drew, even as Biden drained the SPR to try to counteract the price spike.

Long story short, it's true that domestic oil production is now higher than ever (just barely, 13.3K v. 13K), but it took 4 years to get back to the levels of production last seen under Trump.

Have homelessness and poverty gotten better, or worse, since Biden was elected?

Before you reply, it's a loaded question, the answer is:

Reagan appointed Greenspan to deregulate Wallstreet, Clinton further supported Greenspan and signed the repeal of Glass-Steagal which had kept the banking system sound for 80 years.   The ideology is neoliberalism in the technical economic sense, which was a departure from Keynesian embedded liberalism.

Neoliberalism is marked by the defunding of government agencies, institutions, regulatory agencies and privatizing them or eradicating them.  Reagan the Thatcher brought about the global restructuring of western economies to fit the neoliberal model which roughly was ""trickle down"".  That produced the poverty and inequality we see today. 

There is no doubt the economy is better under Biden than Trump. The metrics are there, the bottom of the economy though is not seeing the turnaround that higher income levels of the economy are seeing.

Shops would be allowed to open on two Sundays each month, with staff receiving double pay on those days and an extra day off work in return.

&gt;The ban was introduced in 2018 under the former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government following a campaign in favour of it by the Solidarity trade union and Catholic church.

&gt;Restoring Sunday trading at least partially was one of the election promises of the centrist Poland 2050 (Polska 2050), which is part of a new ruling coalition that replaced PiS in power in December. The main ruling group, Donald Tusks Civic Coalition (KO), has also pledged to end the trading ban.

&gt;However, PiS, now in opposition, and the Solidarity trade union have expressed opposition to any such move. Another member of Tusks ruling coalition, The Left (Lewica), is also sceptical of the idea.

&gt;

&gt;One of Poland 2050s MPs, Ryszard Petru, says that his partys new proposal represents a compromise between full trade liberalisation and the current ban.

&gt;Whereas currently most shops are only allowed to open on seven Sundays a year, the proposed law would allow them to trade on the first and third Sunday of every month.

&gt;In return, retail workers would receive double pay on those days and employers would be additionally obliged to grant an employee working on Sunday one day off within six days before or six days after the working Sunday.

&gt;Petru cited estimates that the liberalisation of Sunday trading would result in a 4% increase in turnover for the retail sector while employment could rise by 40,000. He said that Poland 2050 will urge all coalition partners to support this project.

&gt;

&gt;One of those partners, KO, before last years elections listed ending the Sunday trading ban as one of the [100 policies it aimed to introduce within 100 days](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/09/11/polish-opposition-outlines-100-policies-for-first-100-days-in-office/) of taking office (but [most of which it has failed to implement](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/03/18/polish-government-has-fulfilled-only-12-of-tusks-promised-100-policies-in-first-100-days-in-office/)).

&gt;However, their other coalition partner, The Left, is not keen on the idea. One of its leading figures, family, labour and social policy minister Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bk, noted today in response to Poland 2050s proposal that Poles already work [among the longest hours in Europe](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/09/22/poles-work-eus-second-most-hours-per-week/).

&gt;We lack time to rest, and the traditional day to rest and spend time with family is Sunday, said Dziemianowicz-Bk, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP). Hence the deep scepticism towards any proposals to introduce working Sundays.","1","I"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1blzybq/polish_ruling_coalition_party_submits_bill_to/","BubsyFanboy","2024-03-23",1711220811,1,1,0,0,"&gt;PiS politician Daniel Milewski, welcomed the fact that a number of figures from The Left have voiced opposition to ending the Sunday trading ban.

&gt;When we introduced \[it\]&we were made out to be religious fundamentalists, Milewski told TV Republika. But it was about families \[not church\].

&gt;Meanwhile Alfred Bujara, head of the retail workers section of the Solidarity trade union, condemned Poland 2050s proposal, telling *Tydognik Solidarno[ci* that restoring Sunday trading would be a huge blow to Polands two million retail workers, 72% of whom are women.

&gt;I talk to these women. They cant imagine having to work on Sunday. They also dont believe in \[promises\] of any allowances or bonuses \[for working on Sunday\], because employers are very rapacious on this issue, he added.

&gt;

&gt;Earlier this week, before the draft law was presented, the deputy head of the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ), Sebastian Kowin, also argued that the trade ban was supported by industry workers.

&gt;Trade is Polands largest employment sector. According to data from Statistics Poland (GUS), a state agency, in 2020 between 1.5 and 2 million people worked in trade, or around 4.6% of all employees.

&gt;According to polling by UCE Research for the *Rzeczpospolita* daily, the public has become more accepting of the trade ban. Last month, only 44% wanted to restore Sunday trading, down from 54% in September.","1_1","I"

I've been doing the minimum $500/year payment hoping the government would at some point let us have the rest for free. Shortly after this credit they came out with a more substantial credit that didn't have to be paid back. 2008 was a shit year to buy a house. I was underwater for 10ish years. I have tons of equity in it now though.

I honestly don't even know where the $7,500 went. Back then I was young and dumb and wasn't really keeping a close eye on my finances. If I had of invested all of the credit it would be worth over $40,000 today.

Biden's $10K plan is designed to further stimulate demand.  What we're seeing is interference with price discovery by central planners that results in misallocations of capital.   

If the central planners in the US are to do anything, it should be the acceleration of supply.  It is China that needs acceleration of demand.    The chief benefit of free markets implied by capitalism is the efficient use of capital.   The central planning by the Federal Reserve in the U.S. has defeated the efficient use of capital since the collapse in 2008, instead focusing on increasing the wealth of the one percent, and making sure that the rabble will own nothing and rent everything by 2030.","2","I"

All I could do at the time is fantasize about how much easier the work I was doing would be made easier.

I understand the hate and the panic with the way it is presented. I have received some of that hate with my viewpoint; but in all honesty, my views have not changed much from then, when it was in a lab setting, to now. The truth is a lot of ""AI"" systems are already implemented and being used daily. In my line of work it just cuts down a lot of the busy work. You still need to know how to use the tools, it doesn't stifle creativity; in fact I'd argue it makes it easier because I am not using all my brain power to achieve the idea to begin with.

When you see them as and use them as tools; I don't see them as anything different as using machines instead of people or animals. I doubt, but I could be wrong, that I will ever truly interact with a computer that has full autonomy and free agency. Until then, I'll use the best tool available to me to get a job done.

I foresee three possible outcomes with the most likely being humans fighting over an increasingly shrinking pool of largely BS jobs due to our inability to divorce worth from work. 

Scenario A. What we have now (but worse)

Basically companies have no incentives to retain human employees and governments make no efforts to offset the system with programs like UBI and job retraining. In this scenario the economy just keeps continuing, hitting that initial [40%](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity) disruption mark and no new jobs become available. Trades are the last to go, as people rush to fill previously overlook rolls in the trade sector. White Collar jobs are pretty much automated, and the wealth made is consolidated by a small group of the ultra-wealthy who either own AI or maintain AI.

Scenario B.  Freemium Existince

The government doesn't want to let people starve (or more accurately, riot) so they throw the poor a bone. A psuedo UBI is formed where things deemed necessities are either given to everyone or purchasable with a UBI currency. 

Luxury goods, which will be a wide net, can still only be purchased with the currency earned from maintaining one of the few remaining jobs. Most people aren't starving, but they aren't particularly happy since this still creates a significant class divide. The economy kicks its green washing and marketing into high gear, pitching every new product as worthy of the premium currency (organic food, premium subscriptions, high end services, etc). This makes an economy that is largely redundant, but we maintain the lie to keep some semblance of what we have now.

Scenario C. Everyone's Bored.

The least likely scenario. Basically the governments of the world just enact UBI. Those who can still work for more money do so, but everyone's covered. The funding is done through heavy taxation of the few remaining wealth-makers of the world, who enjoy some protection as they get to experiment with all the emerging tech AI will inevitably create. 

Because everyone's basic needs are met most people flock to passive industries like the influencer market. There's not real problems (outside the usual suspects), but everyone kinda languors because we just killed the last vestiges of the concept of scarcity. It's a kinda boring psuedo-utopia where people need to find things to fill their hours. Economies exists, but like in Scenario B they really only exist to distract humans and aren't really needed.

&amp;#x200B;

If history has taught one thing it's that people don't easily give up their power, so I don't think wealth divides will ever truly go away. They will only reshape around what is needed to keep society going.","3","I"

However, this was also 0% on savings, and this pushed everyone(including the older population) to more risky investments such as real estate speculation, and stocks, and this contributes to inflation.  In fact, the reason why the FED reduces rates is to create this effect(they call it the wealth effect) to get out of a deflationary environment.  Personally, I like to see a perfect balance for people to speculatively invest for a higher return, but also have a savings rate that is near sufficient for the risk averse.","4","I"

More truth that the Hasbara trolls won't like:

1 - Netanyahu is prosecuting this genocide to remain in and consolidate power, which weakens Israel globally.

This is similar to Putin waging war in Ukraine to help him keep and consolidate power and distract from Russia's domestic issues.

2) Israel needs to get the fuck out of interfering in US politics, just as much as Russia and our other foreign adversaries do.

AIPAC should be labeled as a foreign lobbying organization as it should have been for the past several decades.

3) It is and has been illegal for our tax dollars to be supporting Israel's apartheid and now genocide against the Palestinians.  We need to follow our own laws if we want any credibility with respect to the ""rules-based international order"".

Funding Israel's genocide catastrophically undercuts US global credibility and institutions, and pure self-interest should have us kicking AIPAC/Israel out of Congress.

I saw the videos of the October 7th attack and it's really brutal. I cannot imagine living next to an organization that is willing to just attack civilians like this and then hide in another group of civilians that also support them.

I'd have another opinion if the civilian were turning in hamas or trying to fight hamas along with Israel but that is not happening.  Instead I see videos of them cheering when things like 9/11 happen or charlie hebdo happen.","6_1_2","I"

The idea is to intercede in an area of conflict and famine, and that a lack thereof constitutes culpability. So just apply that reasoning more broadly, globally, to anywhere in the world where millions are dying from famine- under which there are almost always conflict-driven underpinnings.      

It would be a logical fallacy therefore to limit this view just to where its politically convenient and in the news. If were going to do the right thing, do the right thing everywhere. If were not, dont pat yourself on the back too hard, youre either deceived or a hypocrite. Youre a punchline and you dont even understand the joke.","9_1","I"
