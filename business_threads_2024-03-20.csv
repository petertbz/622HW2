I have 40% and am the founder and I have 3 partners with 20% each. They came in right before opening (took me around 2 years with build out and licensing etc) to do day to day operations. The business has been running for 2 years now, they expressed interest in selling shares to move and invest in other things. I will go back to operating the day to day as I have more time now, than I did 2 years ago. 

Details:
- Business did around $700k in sales year 1
- year 2 we did just under $2m and we are tracking good for a $2.5m+ year 3
-the last 2 years we have not taken money from the company really (they pay themselves a small salary) and spent most of our money on growing the business
- lease has 7 years left + 3 year option at a very very good rate for our area. The lease alone is worth a bunch of money
- they want $250k each, so $750k total
- we talked about a full sell but I would rather keep it long term 
- I have talked to a few wealthy friends about them buying some of the shares and being silent. As it is already making money their distributions will basically be immediate
- if the investors do work out or not I want to look at all my options, like loans, this is where I need advice
-  the business has around $477k in assets 
- personal credit isn't great 650-700. I don't have much history (I'm 35), bought most of my stuff out right growing up. I have some credit cards a motorcycle loan and a car loan, all paid on time. 


I have never taken a loan this big. This business has almost no debt except a small payment for the liquor license (financed $140k 2 years ago. it is privately financed though an attorney that buys and flips them with his own financing). This business was purely bootstraped. I have another small bar and have had several others over the last decade so I'm pretty competent when it comes to creating and running successful food establishments. I do all the physical build out work myself barring any very technical stuff or what the city requires me to us a GC for. The only other loan I have had to take out was for my other spot and was SBA EIDL loan during Covid. 

My partner put me in touch with a loan broker or something and they mentioned having a few options (forgive me if anything is written wrong or dumb, I'm using their words). Something about a line of credit, which doesn't make sense to me. A large LOC that immediately gets fully spent, doesn't seem like a bank will like that. He asked me to use a site called IdentityIQ for a credit report so the bank does not do a hard pull, because I believe this broker works with mostly small firms. He was saying it is non secured, but I am fine with a secured loan against the assets. I'm not going anywhere. 

 If anyone can suggest other firms/companies or banks they have used that would be very helpful. Just in the interest of being cautious, I want to do my own due diligence before I go with a friend of a friend. If the investors are on board I would still want to get to majority % using a loan or some sort. 

Let me know any other details you need. I have been trying to search online for options but I get a bunch of weird online loan firms. Im looking into SBA as well. It's a large amount so I'm just a little lost. My accountant is doing to looking for me as well. Thanks in advance!","business",20,20,0,1,0,0,0,18

My partner and I own a high volume home care agency. We have a very high payroll (about 2 million a month). We currently have a local payroll company that we use. We pay our staff every 2 weeks and it's debited from our account through Ach. 

Capital one got in contact with us and stated that paying through a credit card would give us cash back and better tax incentives at the end of the year. It just sounded odd.  Anyone have any thoughts on this? Do companies do it this way? They want to charge us 2.99% interest rate ","business",5,5,0,0.86,0,0,0,13

The company I work for was recently sold to KKR which is a private equity firm. My company is a great company in the energy sector and has tons of revenue and profit upside historically but due to mismanagement in the last 2 years, we lost a lot of money. Given the cash crunch, the leadership sold the company to KKR. 

My company offers great compensation and bonuses. For instance I earn a base of 160k and a bonus of 60k per year for a total compensation of $220k per year. 

Has anyone worked for a company bought by KKR? How were the salaries impacted? How does KKR structure annual bonuses? 

They also offer stock options to employees. Do you know how much they offer in general and how valuable they are?

I live fairly comfortably, pay off my debts, I have a free gym and some other perks. 

However the company growth is stagnant and I've heard there's problems. Also there's a job posting on my company website that describes my work to a T but management has expressed I'm not being replaced. I don't know if I want to believe that.

I can almost guarantee to get an offer at a different company. It's remote but three time zones away. I'd take a 10k pay hit (if I can talk them up 10k that is) and I would lose some strong benefits. 

I also don't know how the tax situation would work, working in one state while the company is headquartered in another.

Any advice on what direction to head in? I appreciate advice from anyone who has been in similar shoes. ","business",1,1,0,0.67,0,0,0,1

The concentration is management. For the last several months I planned on immediately going to get my MBA at Clemson. I even had my class schedule and everything done, but didnt do my due diligence when actually looking at what MBAs are for, and I was heavily advised to get a few years of work experience before pursuing my masters.

Now I feel lost on what to do because I had planned on moving to Greenville and being in school for another year and a half, but now Im a month out from graduating and have no clue what I want to do or how to even start looking. Trying to figure out exactly what i wanted to do wasnt a priority because I planned on being in grad school for until next fall, but all of the sudden I have a month to figure it out.

Am I making a mistake by waiting on grad school? Should I try and get a summer internship while I figure out what I want to do? Is it hard to get into work right after graduation? Any advice will be greatly appreciated because its been an overwhelming week.
