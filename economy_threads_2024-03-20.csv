https://preview.redd.it/fbtpyjmtfhpc1.png?width=334&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=867d6d3d1f14e9165bf63b1435716f977e350a25

***Photo above*** * President Biden's tax returns show that he and his wife collect $50,000 a year from social security, $130,000 from his senate pension (80% of his senate pay), and will soon receive $200,000 a year in Presidential pension. Jill Biden also collects a full pension from her work as public-school teacher. They apparently do not have a 401K account.*

If you're like me, you don't have a retirement pension. Instead, you have a defined contribution plan. A defined contribution plan means your company throws a little money into a 401K, in your name. You're free to add more out of your own paycheck, if you're smart enough to figure out you couldn't retire on the share contributed by your company. And taxes might be deferred (in some cases) on the money you chip in. But then we pay full tax on this money the moment we retire.

**Say goodbye to all that. See link below.**

Leading economists (from an NGO  a non governmental organization staffed with former bureaucrats) are floating a proposal: kill our 401K accounts. This is how our government road tests weird ideas before writing them into law. Someone in government (at the Social Security Administration, the White House, or some congressional committee) has proposed killing 401k's, but it wasn't this obscure think tank.

In the past, this sort of trial balloon has been the first step in creating ridiculous policies. Like sanctuary cities. Or keeping more than 800 US military bases open worldwide. Legalization of narcotics and prostitution. If we don't object - early and often - then it becomes law. None of us actually votes to allow our neighborhood to become a sanctuary city. It just sort of happens when we're not paying attention.

**Back to ending our 401K accounts**. The rationale is hilariously simple, but officials believe we won't understand it. Starting point: The government is out of money, because it spends twice as much as it collects in taxes. Step two: nobody wants their social security tax to go up. Or benefits cut. Or the retirement age raised again. Conclusion: take all those 401K contributions and use that money to prop up Social Security. Then declare *Social Security be saved, praise the Lord.* And then we have another Social Security crisis in 5-7 years, right?

I don't believe social security will disappear completely. But I don't believe it will ever pay enough for me to afford a (safe) apartment, groceries, electricity, and my own share of my retiree health insurance. Defined contribution plans - my own savings - have almost totally replaced legitimate pensions in corporate America. Most of the people who still get pensions are  Ka-Ching! - government workers. Their pensions are indexed for inflation, too, unlike our defined contribution plans. If you want to really get outraged, start googling for situations where retiring police captains get promoted to the rank of Major on their last day of work, to goose up their pensions for life.

Now, you and I won't even get the 401K which replaced pensions. The government wants that money. This proposal is the first step to see if anyone is paying attention.

In the meantime, the government continues to bleed out. We have the world's biggest military. The biggest influx of illegal aliens, most of whom need government assistance. The biggest mountain of student loans. The highest housing prices. Plus, some of the highest income taxes in the civilized world. There's a Chinese government troll someplace else in this forum telling us that capitalism has failed, and the dollar is dead.

If we want to lose our 401Ks - our only hope of a normal retirement  - and avoid ending up in Section 8 housing and living on Food stamps, there's nothing we need to do. It will all happen without us even having to lift a finger.

I'm just sayin' . . .
