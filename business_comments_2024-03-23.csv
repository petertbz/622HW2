Already, the company has started catering to high-earning customers. Yolanda Jones, a 48-year-old from St. Louis, Missouri, told the news outlet that she thought she hit the jackpot when she stumbled upon duck breast in her local Walmart. 

In Secaucus, New Jersey, consumers can find jars of red sauce from Carbone and top-of-the-line beauty products from Skingym and Mario Badescu. In terms of apparel, the stores have added labels including Reebok and US Polo Association.

Jordan Berke, a former Walmart executive, told Bloomberg that the retail giant has a history of studying consumer behavior to better grasp what luxury shoppers actually wantand the effort is clearly paying off. 

According to data from Placer.ai, households earning between $100,000 to $150,000 a year flocked to the retailer last year and were the second-biggest group of Walmart shoppers in 2023, which is largely a result of inflation.

Walmart hired Denise Incandela as executive vice president of fashion and private brands. Incandela, whos previously worked for Ralph Lauren Corp. and Saks Fifth Avenue Inc., is hoping to find success with a younger generation of higher-income consumers by stocking stores with trendy blouses and jumpsuits. Gen Z shoppers are leading the luxury market, after all.","1"

Not exactly the best cheerleaders on the planet. So the people who want to decentralize everything to make it harder to regulate want to decentralize this to protect the planet?

Oh dont get me wrong i can see problems with everything being in googles hands but i can see also the problem with it being.. well unregulated and decentralized would make that very hard.

so give me more than, having it controlled by a couple companies sucks, and how we should deal with the problems that come with decentralization as centralization is definitely easier to regulate.","2"

*These software engineers are from India, Pakistan and they are unprofessional, money sucking leeches, liars and are horrible. I don't know if it's the country or what.*

How much are you paying them? $5/hour, $10/per hour? How did you evaluate them? It's very easy to pass the blame. Hiring is your responsibility. Every profession has people who are good, back &amp; ugly.

They are not liers. They are just bad at what they do. Most people who suck at their job don't know it.

In India, for every pay scale range $5-$10, $10-$15, $15-$20, $20-$30, you can easily have a few thousand people ready to work (job applications). It's crucial to hire the top talent from each bracket. Yes, it's a lot of effort, but it pays in the long run.

My recommendation is to hire a permanent developer, a good one (top 90th percentile).

1. Fix significant bugs - this would be painful &amp; will take a lot more effort. Bite the bullet.
2. In parallel, re-write the app.
3. In the rewrite - make sure QA or testing is super important. In an ideal world, a good developer would also test things well. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Most freelancers &amp; contractors don't like to do testing. Even below-average code can work well up to a point if tested well.

The team was dedicated to our department and had a queue of programs to develop, that all ran on the same platform on our servers.   They were very well versed in both the development and production environments and our business analysts knew that they had to write very detailed specs with no margin for guesswork and we still received a lot of buggy software that went back multiple times for corrections before it could be moved to production.   The trick was to write such extensive specs that you could specify that the code is not doing x.  Up front when hiring the, the contract must also specify what the scope is, the cost and what the expectations are for correcting bugs.   A lot of the issue was the language barrier.  Many times, we had flow charts, example calculations, and mocked up screens and reports along with the written specs to help them understand what we needed.  They would often remind us that garbage in = garbage out and that included specs where we assumed that they understood a vague request.  I once had to pay 10k to enhance a screen, because we didn't specify that we needed a print button n it even though we had specified the output of a printed report. It was ridiculous in our minds, but we learned our lesson.","4"

Assuming you have detailed documentation that states due dates, amounts, and a definition of a complete project, youll be fine with small claims. The court can place a lien on the customers assets if needed.

In the future, your terms need to outline due date, consequences of missing the due date, and final consequences. For example, due on the day of job completion; late after 10 business days which rescinds all discounts; relationship terminated at 30 calendar days. Take them to court on day 31.","7"
