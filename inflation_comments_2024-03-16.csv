I'm on day five of a huge meatloaf I made earlier this week (Chef John's ""Prison Meatloaf"" minus the parmesean). Had it w linguine and tomato sauce two nights, mushroom gravy n potatoes the next two. Tonight will be SOS on toast w gravy. Will finish it up by Monday. That's $2 per portion meatloaf w $1 side dishes per day for dinner.

I used to live w someone who refused leftover food. Fridge was packed w to-go containers well past prime. Once a week, I tossed at least $100 of leftover carryout bc the entitled bih wouldn't cook. This is a choice, esp today. W YouTube and the metric fkton of reputable food websites out there, NO ONE has an excuse to not know how to boil a goddamn egg or whip up fresh mashed potatoes. 

And with just a little dedication and practice, you can easily replicate the Big Mac, Chili's Southwestern Egg Rolls, Taco Bell's everything, and even Church's-KFC-Popeyes. It's not hard. There's Church's wings n fries on my meal plan for Monday. Twelve-hour marinade, seven minutes to cook. It's doable, folks. You can cut off from restaurants. Since 2020, I've saved $14,000 eating at home. Fck these restaurants.","3_1_2"

But lately, their prices have been absurd. Instead, I've started making my own breakfast and it's both healthier and tastier.


This is my signature breakfast burrito that I've been making several times a week for the last year. It's about 700 calories and packed with protein so it fuels me fully until lunch.


It includes:


2 hash browns, 1 egg, 3 small breakfast sausage links, a small handful of shredded mozzarella cheese, hot salsa, and a table spoon of olive oil, all wrapped up in a large burrito wrap.

For example, mcdonalds in denmark paid workers the equivalent of 22 usd an hour....in 2020.....and they have to, by law, give them a MINIMUM of 4 weeks of paid vacation, often more. 

Check out the big Mac index. It shows prices of the big Mac across the world. According to this, the bigmac in the US is the SAME PRICE as in denmark...in 2024!

We are being abused by the rich and their corporations, plain and simple. The reason why debmark gets such benefits is extremely strong unions, and EU policy.

My point is that corporations don't learn, they go right up to the line and see how much they can go over it until it affects their income, then they move back a little bit, but farther than it was before, and repeat the process. 


We need super strong unions and super strong labor laws before any of this will get better.","60_2"

But in my way of thinking, as long as the interest rate on the debt (home, car, student loans, etc) isnt high (~4% or more), I am much less inclined to pay on it faster than I need to when times are uncertain.  If I dont have at least a years worth of savings, I want to build that first in case we do fall into a recession and I lose my job.  Plus, when rates are high and you can get over 4% currently in a HYSA, savings arent going to waste, and your earnings can offset/exceed interest accrued (if any) on outstanding debt.

That said, this only works if youre smart with your money and not just blowing what youd be paying on your debt.  And I agree, the owner class loves consumer debt.  It enables a great amount of people to buy expensive things for more money than they can really afford.

Credit card debt to income ratio (what actually matters as it represents ability to pay back) is actually pretty low compared to history.

A few people ratcheting back on the silly spending won't put pressure on the big co.'s.  I parallel this to the Disney World phenomenon: We stopped going to Disney after November 2019 with covid, and then when they jacked their prices in 2020 to present and you have to buy lightning lanes etc now and use an app all day on your iPhone for some stuff. So WE priced-out (actually we could totally still afford it, but we just spend less money on other cheaper vacay spots, now), but people keep going and paying the even higher and higher prices. The question now is what's the breaking point?  When WILL co's see it in their bottom line?  The Disney answer is, some people keep paying MORE for less product.

How China Escaped Shock Therapy 

It goes from 400 bc through the 1980s reform period and explains their economic systems and changes.

In many times the goal is stability instead of in the current US where max profit is the only locus. We value things like the stock market and GDP.

In the book The regimes in powered decisions to create stability. Here is an example. 

In time of bumper crops the govt would buy a ton in fall at a 10 percent markup price to keep prices up for farmers as speculators pushed prices down. In the spring they would sell it to the peasants wjen prices were higher at a 10 percent discount to help people afford the food and check the speculators. 

They use the government for what it's supposed to be used for, protecting people not protecting capital. Anything that doesn't protect capital at all costs is a danger to US hegemony.

There are many many examples in the book like this, please take a read. These are all choices we make and in thr US we prefer to guarantee the rate of return on capital over everything else. Once that sunk in for me things changed.","48"
