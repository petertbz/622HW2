 ***Photo above*** * Jeff Bezos and other gazillionaires are funding startups to extend the human lifespan to 100. But does anyone want hundred-year-old guys running Amazon, Tesla, and in the White House?*

Okay first off  nobody actually knows how high republicans want to raise the retirement age. At least, if anyone does, they're not saying. But they do claim that  whatever the new retirement age turns out to be  it's going to save the government $1.5 trillion. But that's over 10 years. And that couldn't possibly be just straight lining $150 billion each year. It'll start way lower, and then  if there are no more medical advances extending the human lifespan  this plan might possibly start make sense at the end. See link at bottom.

Related news - several billionaires are funding startups to extend the human lifespan to 100. At least for themselves. If the whole world lives to age 100, and needs 10 pills a day, exoskeletons just to walk, and exotic radiation treatments, it's going to cost about $1.5 trillion a minute to deliver all that.

I don't really care if Bill Gates wants to live to 100. If he can pay for it, then sure. Just don't include it in Medicare Part A, paid for by the existing programs. That will bankrupt both Medicare AND Social Security.

So the republican proposal  to save $1.5 trillion, later, maybe - is just an election year campaign stunt. At least until someone can also tell us what age we have to keep working til. THEN the screaming and yelling can start. Will men get to retire 3 years earlier than women? They die 3 years earlier. There are a lot of interesting questions which could derail this proposal without a bill ever coming to a vote.

Today's republican press release is every bit as unserious as the Democrat proposal (earlier this week) to make 401K's illegal, and use our retirement accounts to ""rescue"" social security.

So at last we have a choice! Work until death or, have all our savings confiscated by the government. Why can't it be both at the same time, though? Let's not rule anything out, at this stage.

At the risk of telling congress (and the presidential candidates) what they already know, let me remind everyone of the following:  


* Barring another pandemic, American lifespans will keep increasing.
* Longer lifespans mean higher Medicare and Social Security expenses.
* Requiring old fogies to stay on the job means that Gen X, Y and Z people won't get promotions. They might have keep living in their parent's basements. No wonder young people hate the GOP.
* If we DO have another pandemic, then Medicare and other health costs will go over the moon again. During covid 19 we had to spend Trillions just to prevent riots. Oh wait, my bad . . . we did have those, on January 6th.
* I'm personally uncomfortable with a ruling class that is nearly 2 decades past retirement. They already need extraordinary medical care. This strikes me as some sort of conflict of interest, when debating retirement policy.  


I might sign up for a higher retirement age if someone puts an actual number on the table. I might also agree to pay more in health insurance premiums to cover for my medical expenses as the lifespans increase. I might even allow robots to care for me in a hospice as I lay dying. But none of this is going to come cheap. And both parties are flipping us the bird, and insulting our intelligence, about the money involved.

I'm just saying . . .

* China (5+%) and Russia's (3+)% economies are growing
* The West is deindustrializing
* The EU is demanding that China balance its trade surplus.  China is willing but US sanctions won't let the EU export what China wants so China is going to balance its trade by reducing exports to Europe.
* The neocons (libs) still believe Biden will win and that the Russian population will turn on Putin.  This will not happen.
* The neocon narrative is being changed to insist a loss in Ukraine doesn't matter because of US ""soft power"" coined by Joseph Nye in 1987.  [The article referred to is here](https://archive.is/OI21w).

* Hudson dismisses these 5 reasons as ""hilarious"".  
* Our neighbors are not ""friendly"", the genocide in Gaza shows what America really stands for.
* Domestic US energy doesn't stop the rest of the world from accessing energy.
* The world is de-dollarizing as fast as it can.  The US has threatened Saudi Arabia saying if they don't continue to support the metro-dollar the US will consider it an act of war.
* The US cannot maintain tech leadership.  \[China graduates 8x US STEM graduates, many graduating from US institutions are Chinese\]
* Russia is now the largest economy in Europe based on PPP.
* \[Haiphong says 48 economists predict EU growth at less than 0.6%\]

* Russia and China don't need Europe or the US.

WRT Putins claim that Russia is now the largest economy in Europe, as [Snopes points out](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/russia-largest-economy-in-europe/), it is based on PPP.  If you saw Tucker Carlson buying groceries in Moscow and his surprise that what he thought would be $400 was only $100 this is what PPP is all about.  Nominal GDP numbers will be quite different, but pretty much meaningless in the context that Putin was talking about.","economy",0,0,0,0.29,0,0,2,12
