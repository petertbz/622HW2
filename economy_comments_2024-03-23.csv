Higher labor costs are the result of government caused inflation, not the cause of the inflation itself.  Read Mises or Friedman.  Inflation is cause by governments inflating the amount of money in the economy or through driving down the value of money.  It's been going on since the middle-ages when kings devalued money by clipping the edges of coins reducing the weight of the coins and lowering the value of the money.  The Biden administration just floods the market with paper dollars fundamentally doing the same to our money today.","1"

I make widgets. I want more profit. I don't want to do the hard work of reducing operation costs. My widget sells for $1.00. I now sell my widget for $2.00.

They can find other widgets, maybe, but those widgets will increase in price as they notice my strategy worked.

Inflation, way over simplified but I've seen this more or less in the real world and within my own company. We aren't charging more for any reason other than leadership demanded us to, despite no increase in our costs.

This in turn allowed companies to have more efficient design process allowing companies to produce more. It only makes sense with automation, tech advancements that the conversation of shortening the work week comes up.

I don't know how this works. Many Americans don't work 30 hours a week as it's considered full time and comes with benefits. I doubt salaried workers will be limited to 30 hours a week.

&gt;If passedan outcome that seems highly unlikely in todays Washington environment Sanders bill would lower the threshold for which workers are eligible to receive overtime pay and include a four-year transition period to the shorter week. The sad reality is that Americans now work more hours than the people of any other wealthy nation, Sanders said during a Thursday committee hearing.

Voter ID Laws: ALEC has been involved in drafting model legislation for stricter voter ID laws, aimed at reducing voter fraud. These laws have been sponsored by various legislators in different states. An example includes the voter ID law in Wisconsin, sponsored by state Representative Jeff Stone and state Senator Joe Leibham, with involvement from corporations like Koch Industries.  
Private Prison Legislation: ALEC has developed model bills that promote the use of private prisons. For instance, Arizona's SB 1070, a controversial immigration bill, was influenced by ALEC's model legislation. Corporations like Corrections Corporation of America (now CoreCivic), which operates private prisons, were involved in ALEC during this period. The bill was sponsored by state Senator Russell Pearce.  
Environmental Deregulation: ALEC has also been involved in creating model legislation that seeks to roll back environmental regulations. This includes bills that challenge the EPA's regulatory authority. Legislators in various states have introduced these bills, often with backing from energy companies like ExxonMobil and Peabody Energy.  
Telecommunications Legislation: ALEC's model bills have included legislation favoring telecommunications companies, like easing regulations for broadband and cable companies. An example is legislation related to municipal broadband, limiting the ability of cities to create their own broadband services in competition with private companies. Telecom companies like AT&amp;T and Comcast have been involved in these efforts.

US domestic oil production rose from 9K/day when Obama left office to 13K/day under Trump, just before COVID hit in 2020.

Then, COVID. And with COVID came lockdowns and demand for oil fell precipitously, along with production, but the production capacity had been built, under Trump.

Then, Biden took office in Jan 2021 and he made it clear on his first day that fossil fuels were a dead energy policy and the future was green. Investments drained from fossil fuels and into greener energies.

That was huge policy mistake and we all paid for it for the next 3 years with gasoline prices rising more than 100% as post-COVID demand drew, even as Biden drained the SPR to try to counteract the price spike.

Long story short, it's true that domestic oil production is now higher than ever (just barely, 13.3K v. 13K), but it took 4 years to get back to the levels of production last seen under Trump.

It's also true that gasoline prices are still 45% higher now than when Biden took office, so we're all still paying for that policy gaffe on Day 1.","3"

It was under 11,000 barrels per day when Trump left office. It's increased every year since then under Biden. It's now higher than it ever was under Trump. You also neglected that the shale oil revolution began under Obama, and Trump just benefited from it.

I acknowledged this...this is what I said.. 


&gt; *Production crashed because of government response to covid* 


.


&gt; Biden inherited a disaster.  


The disaster was a result of staying shutdown for too long and printing 6 trillion dollars. 


Biden and his Democrat buddies wanted longer shutdowns and more dollars, 


Trump wanted the shutdowns over by fall 2020, and everyone back to work. 


But Biden was elected, and the other 3 trillion was signed off and printed. 


&gt; And it's now fully recovered and stronger than it's ever been.  


Thats a joke right? 


Groceries have doubled since Trump. 


Gas has gotten more expensive. 


Inflation is sky high. 


Fast food is sky high. 


Cars are way more expensive. 


Everything costs more. 


To top it off, our elected officials are still writing bills that are overbudget, continuing to contribute to the debt, borrowing and printing more dollars, making our money less valuable everyday.


&gt; Fyi the economy was also fantastic when Trump took office. 


Yes, and he continued the fantastic economy until a novel deadly virus spread across the globe. 


The country was better off under Trump.

Reagan appointed Greenspan to deregulate Wallstreet, Clinton further supported Greenspan and signed the repeal of Glass-Steagal which had kept the banking system sound for 80 years.   The ideology is neoliberalism in the technical economic sense, which was a departure from Keynesian embedded liberalism.

Neoliberalism is marked by the defunding of government agencies, institutions, regulatory agencies and privatizing them or eradicating them.  Reagan the Thatcher brought about the global restructuring of western economies to fit the neoliberal model which roughly was ""trickle down"".  That produced the poverty and inequality we see today. 

There is no doubt the economy is better under Biden than Trump. The metrics are there, the bottom of the economy though is not seeing the turnaround that higher income levels of the economy are seeing.

Shops would be allowed to open on two Sundays each month, with staff receiving double pay on those days and an extra day off work in return.

&gt;The ban was introduced in 2018 under the former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government following a campaign in favour of it by the Solidarity trade union and Catholic church.

&gt;Restoring Sunday trading at least partially was one of the election promises of the centrist Poland 2050 (Polska 2050), which is part of a new ruling coalition that replaced PiS in power in December. The main ruling group, Donald Tusks Civic Coalition (KO), has also pledged to end the trading ban.

&gt;However, PiS, now in opposition, and the Solidarity trade union have expressed opposition to any such move. Another member of Tusks ruling coalition, The Left (Lewica), is also sceptical of the idea.

&gt;

&gt;One of Poland 2050s MPs, Ryszard Petru, says that his partys new proposal represents a compromise between full trade liberalisation and the current ban.

&gt;Whereas currently most shops are only allowed to open on seven Sundays a year, the proposed law would allow them to trade on the first and third Sunday of every month.

&gt;In return, retail workers would receive double pay on those days and employers would be additionally obliged to grant an employee working on Sunday one day off within six days before or six days after the working Sunday.

&gt;Petru cited estimates that the liberalisation of Sunday trading would result in a 4% increase in turnover for the retail sector while employment could rise by 40,000. He said that Poland 2050 will urge all coalition partners to support this project.

&gt;

&gt;One of those partners, KO, before last years elections listed ending the Sunday trading ban as one of the [100 policies it aimed to introduce within 100 days](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/09/11/polish-opposition-outlines-100-policies-for-first-100-days-in-office/) of taking office (but [most of which it has failed to implement](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/03/18/polish-government-has-fulfilled-only-12-of-tusks-promised-100-policies-in-first-100-days-in-office/)).

&gt;However, their other coalition partner, The Left, is not keen on the idea. One of its leading figures, family, labour and social policy minister Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bk, noted today in response to Poland 2050s proposal that Poles already work [among the longest hours in Europe](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/09/22/poles-work-eus-second-most-hours-per-week/).

&gt;We lack time to rest, and the traditional day to rest and spend time with family is Sunday, said Dziemianowicz-Bk, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP). Hence the deep scepticism towards any proposals to introduce working Sundays.","1"

&gt;When we introduced \[it\]&we were made out to be religious fundamentalists, Milewski told TV Republika. But it was about families \[not church\].

&gt;Meanwhile Alfred Bujara, head of the retail workers section of the Solidarity trade union, condemned Poland 2050s proposal, telling *Tydognik Solidarno[ci* that restoring Sunday trading would be a huge blow to Polands two million retail workers, 72% of whom are women.

&gt;I talk to these women. They cant imagine having to work on Sunday. They also dont believe in \[promises\] of any allowances or bonuses \[for working on Sunday\], because employers are very rapacious on this issue, he added.

&gt;

&gt;Earlier this week, before the draft law was presented, the deputy head of the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ), Sebastian Kowin, also argued that the trade ban was supported by industry workers.

&gt;Trade is Polands largest employment sector. According to data from Statistics Poland (GUS), a state agency, in 2020 between 1.5 and 2 million people worked in trade, or around 4.6% of all employees.

&gt;According to polling by UCE Research for the *Rzeczpospolita* daily, the public has become more accepting of the trade ban. Last month, only 44% wanted to restore Sunday trading, down from 54% in September.","1_1"

I foresee three possible outcomes with the most likely being humans fighting over an increasingly shrinking pool of largely BS jobs due to our inability to divorce worth from work. 

Scenario A. What we have now (but worse)

Basically companies have no incentives to retain human employees and governments make no efforts to offset the system with programs like UBI and job retraining. In this scenario the economy just keeps continuing, hitting that initial [40%](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity) disruption mark and no new jobs become available. Trades are the last to go, as people rush to fill previously overlook rolls in the trade sector. White Collar jobs are pretty much automated, and the wealth made is consolidated by a small group of the ultra-wealthy who either own AI or maintain AI.

Scenario B.  Freemium Existince

The government doesn't want to let people starve (or more accurately, riot) so they throw the poor a bone. A psuedo UBI is formed where things deemed necessities are either given to everyone or purchasable with a UBI currency. 

Luxury goods, which will be a wide net, can still only be purchased with the currency earned from maintaining one of the few remaining jobs. Most people aren't starving, but they aren't particularly happy since this still creates a significant class divide. The economy kicks its green washing and marketing into high gear, pitching every new product as worthy of the premium currency (organic food, premium subscriptions, high end services, etc). This makes an economy that is largely redundant, but we maintain the lie to keep some semblance of what we have now.

Scenario C. Everyone's Bored.

The least likely scenario. Basically the governments of the world just enact UBI. Those who can still work for more money do so, but everyone's covered. The funding is done through heavy taxation of the few remaining wealth-makers of the world, who enjoy some protection as they get to experiment with all the emerging tech AI will inevitably create. 

Because everyone's basic needs are met most people flock to passive industries like the influencer market. There's not real problems (outside the usual suspects), but everyone kinda languors because we just killed the last vestiges of the concept of scarcity. It's a kinda boring psuedo-utopia where people need to find things to fill their hours. Economies exists, but like in Scenario B they really only exist to distract humans and aren't really needed.

&amp;#x200B;

If history has taught one thing it's that people don't easily give up their power, so I don't think wealth divides will ever truly go away. They will only reshape around what is needed to keep society going.","3"

Notwithstanding the Western mainstream media's propaganda, the history of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict didn't start on October 7th;

this isn't a war, it's a genocide.

and the Palestinians' armed resistance against apartheid and now genocide is and was arguably justified.

More truth that the Hasbara trolls won't like:

1 - Netanyahu is prosecuting this genocide to remain in and consolidate power, which weakens Israel globally.

This is similar to Putin waging war in Ukraine to help him keep and consolidate power and distract from Russia's domestic issues.

2) Israel needs to get the fuck out of interfering in US politics, just as much as Russia and our other foreign adversaries do.

AIPAC should be labeled as a foreign lobbying organization as it should have been for the past several decades.

3) It is and has been illegal for our tax dollars to be supporting Israel's apartheid and now genocide against the Palestinians.  We need to follow our own laws if we want any credibility with respect to the ""rules-based international order"".

Funding Israel's genocide catastrophically undercuts US global credibility and institutions, and pure self-interest should have us kicking AIPAC/Israel out of Congress.

4) Out of pure self-interest, Israel needs to stop the genocide, stop the Hasbara lies about the genocide, and get rid of Netanyahu.","6_1"
