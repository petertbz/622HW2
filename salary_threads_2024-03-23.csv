Company X has offered me a job at 110k but it is 5 days a week in person with every other Friday off. However I am waiting on an offer (which I am pretty sure is coming) from company Z which has already talked numbers with me and I was told 135k and it is hybrid remote with only 1-2 days a week in office.

He lies the issue, I have until Monday to respond to the offer from company X. Do I take the job and just bail if company Z comes offering? Do I not take the job and potentially lose both? At the end of the day I know these companies arent there for me and I feel like I should have no connection to eitherm meaning I should take the job and be prepared to bail!","Salary",12,12,0,1,0,0,0,15

Our sales process can be very technical and long (6-36 mos). I have a decent base salary, car allowance, and performance-based bonus.

A 'somewhat' competitor of ours reached out to recruit me. I went through the interview process and recently got an offer.

I enjoy my current organization and management. My main driver to switch would be total compensation.

Based on these numbers, would you counter the offer or just move on?

Current: 139k base (includes car allowance) // 10-25% bonus // total of 156k last year

New: 145k base // commission (0.05% yr 1, 0.025% yr 2, 0.010% yr 3), based on NEW revenue, min 350k to qualify // one time 30k bonus for 2024. \[the benefits are more expensive with this org\]

My absolute min: 160k base // better commission (2%, 1%, 0.5%)

In my industry, I've seen roles listed that pay up to 180k base, and I've seen commissions up to 3%/2%/1%.","Salary",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1
