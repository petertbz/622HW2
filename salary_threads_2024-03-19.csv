We have a form we both fill out where I share my plans/goals/feedback etc., and one of our topics for discussion was salary ranges. She copied over some company resources regarding salary ranges, why your salary is what it is, etc. 

She ALSO copied over a coworkers salary instead of mine by mistake. Background: I have been with this company for over two years. My coworker has been here for about 6 months. My coworker makes SIGNIFICANTLY more money than me. We have the same title, the same day-to-day responsibilities, yet my coworker is making about 25% more than me. Its also worth pointing out that I have access to metrics that quantify that I am doing more work, and at a higher quality than my coworker.

I know my manager shared this by mistake, but am I able to leverage this into a raise? If so, any advice on how to handle this is appreciated. I was told in our call that Im not due for a merit increase for another 6 months, but upon learning this information (albeit by accident) Im wondering if I have any leverage to move that timeline up. 

Edit: I kept it to myself when I saw my coworkers salary, manager does not know that I saw it as far as Im aware. Manager quickly updated our form after realizing her mistake. ","Salary",15,15,0,0.89,0,0,0,26

P.S. The team was not going to open up a position at all but because they heard I was applying, they opened up the position for me. My hiring manager is also very very impressed with my work and academic achievements. Idk if that gives me leverage ","Salary",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,4

As the title says, I have currently been in the car business for about 10 years, sales rep for 4 and have been a business manager for the last 6.  The money is great, with only a high school diploma to my name I make more than most of the people I know.  Im 33 with a wife and two kids that Id love to spend more time with and the car business although is great money, you practically live at the dealership. My problem is trying to find a new career in or out of sales, that can give weekends off but still give me the potential to make $150k+ per year that Ive been making. Looking for advice if anyone else has been here before and how did you do it. ","Salary",1,1,0,0.67,0,0,0,0

A run down of my life, I fell into some bad choices and have 13 years of sobriety under my belt. The past 8 years were spent caring for my mother who passed, which left little time outside of work. I've been with the same company for 8 years, a company notorious for low wages. I'm a chemistry lab tech, working with materials engineers on mixtures. 

Rewind to 2020, a new manager took over and for some reason, he did not care for me. From telling me bathroom breaks were only to be taken on breaks to other department members pulling me aside to ask what his deal was with me. January 2021, several co-workers said their paycheck was substantially larger. I find out that everyone was given a $3 COLA...except for me. When I questioned my direct supervisor she was evasive. After she, the manager, and HR met, their explanation was ""it was a performance raise you didn't qualify for"". I stayed at $19/hour while co-workers were much higher. I stuck it out, that manager eventually quit and I'm the only remaining technician, even after 8 of 10 employees left in September. 

A new manager starts in October and I click with him immediately. He puts the wheels in motion to present a case to get me a raise, which he does, and I go from $20.60 to $25. 

So, here's my dilemma. My industry pays anywhere from $22 to $31 for my position. Couple that with cost of living in Phoenix, $25 is not sustainable to live off of. Furthermore, I've recently been sitting in interviews and they are hiring new hires with no experience at $24. So, how do I go about ""I know you just gave me a 25% raise, but I really need to be paid the industry standard of someone with 8 years experience or I'll have to look elsewhere""?

The way it was discussed during the interview process was travel will be a few days a month. 

There are others within company that part of there job description is full time onsite away from home, and some that spend half a project at the home office and half at the project site.

I am considering mobilizing to the project (1200 miles from home) for a continuous 6 week duration. Part of my request to agree to this was that I would not only expect the normal allotted travel accommodations, but a temporary increase in compensation. 

It seems like my employer is off put that I would expect this. Also that because of corporate rules or standards that they cannot even consider the temporary pay increase. 

Am I off base or unreasonable with my request. Please keep in mind that my regular job duties are plentiful and there is no shortage of work in my normal role, but because of previous experience and capabilities I can fill a gap at the project site.
