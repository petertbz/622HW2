As such I want to get a business degree at some point. What's the best option?

This is what I'm aware of:

1. Minor Less in depth but less time consuming. Don't
want all of my time to spend on startups or whatnot
in college to be taken

2. Double Major Learn more and get a whole degree but
perhaps very time consuming and eats up almost all
of spare time for aforementioned stuff

3. MBA ""Worth"" more (?) but can't be done until after
undergrad is done and, if applying to a tier 1 program
(afaik) will need 5~ years ""work experience"". Would
one that's immediately after undergrad better? While
working a cs job? I'm wondering if this teaches
enough about being an entrepreneurial sales/
businessman.

I don't yet have too many thoughts about a masters in business

Considering the school and that Im majoring in CS, what will I have enough time for while maintaining good grades and being able to be involved in startups during
college? Or just do something after college? Is there much point in getting a major/minor if you get an MBA?

 Thanks!

I live in an up and coming town in upstate NY and think I can flip a few cheap multifamily homes and build a niche from there. That being said it would probably be best to start a company and do it through that rather than personally. So I've never owned a business and this would be my side hustle. I think there is value in doing this and if it takes off I might want to get others to invest, even if I branch off into something outside of flipping houses. Any idea on the difference between LLC and S-Corp? I saw online and through research it sounds like an S-Corp is the way to go. Im a little nervous about moving forward but I'm over the ""it's not the right time"" dilemma, gotta move on with life, it's never perfect. Any and all help is appreciated and encouraged.

Our team is currently in the process of building a comprehensive business suite for SMEs. While building deck, we encountered conflicting advice that left us uncertain. Could you help with your thoughts and guidance?  
**What are we doing?**  
When you hear ERP mind says boring, expensive, confusing and tiresome.We're building a modern ERP, a virtual super assistant for entrepreneurs. Its just not an ERP but a complete business tool kit which improves collaboration, drives traffic by its own and simplifies operations utilising AI/ML to do heavy lifting.  
Currently bootstrapped, we're determined to bring this vision to life  
***Key Doubts and Questions:***  
**(A) How to approach seed investors?**  
**(B) Can these go in deck?**  
In pitch deck, beyond outlining our product information, USPs and other details, I'm considering including additional value propositions. Could you please share you insights on presenting the following points, and how to present them?

  
1. We conducted an extensive survey with help of 80 college students from various Indian cities, reaching out to 230,000 businesses in 120 days. Surprisingly, 26% of them, approximately 60,000 businesses, expressed interest in our proposed product and felt they need it. I'm estimating a conversion rate of at least 10% from this pool upon launch. What are your thoughts?

  
2. We're currently in the final stages of discussions with the world's largest merchant &amp; trade organisation for an adaptation of our product into their network of 1.2 million businesses. I anticipate a 5% adoption rate upon launch. How should we present this opportunity to investors?

  
3. We have over 100+ businesses across different sectors and sizes actively participating in the product curation process. Their invaluable feedback has been instrumental in refining our prototypes.  
Can we leverage these three points as traction in our pitch deck?

  
**(C) Addressing Challenges, how we speak about these?**  
We've built a prototype rather than a beta MVP due to the unique challenges of approaching the traditional ERP market from a fresh perspective. The nature of ERP systems makes it difficult to trim features for an MVP, compounded by our deep-tech approach. With a limited team, we face challenges in development without seed investment. We're exploring two paths: (A) Rapid development with investor support with 4 months launch target or (B) Gradual growth with our current team, supplemented by two additional members, over 1-1.5 years. Any advice on navigating these challenges would be greatly appreciated. Another challenge is convincing &amp; migrating people using existing accounting platforms to ours.

  
**(D) Our Story &amp; Team Information, are there important infos to talk?**  
I started our company fresh out of college, initially focusing on delivering customised tech solutions for businesses. We developed over 120+ custom ERP and web solutions in the past 1.5 years for SME's, an experience that helped recognise the potential for a product, got into extensive research and it led us to transition into a product-based startup.  I've a track record of successfully managing teams of up to 90 size, also held multiple leadership roles during my academic tenure.  (a Tier 2 college ranked among the top 20 in the country by federal government, not sure if this info matters?)  


Our CTO, joined us as a Co-Founder in September 2023 during our transition to a product-centric company, he boasts 22 years of solid technical expertise. Notably, he played a pivotal role as the head of switching technology in the development of Indias UPI system. (UPI facilitated a staggering 117.6 billion transactions in 2023) His extensive experience includes spearheading the creation of large-scale solutions for esteemed institutions such as the Indian Reserve Bank, State Bank, and various Government Security Agencies in India, Singapore, Gulf Countries and Europe.  


Additionally, each section of our new product has been meticulously crafted with constant input from industry experts. Deliberately these experts are selected from diverse backgrounds, who're working in small to large businesses and various regions. This approach ensures that our product is not only robust but also practically adaptable to the operational requirements across different sectors and geographical areas. It ensure the practicality and relevance of our product.  


We're also proud participants in startup programs run by Microsoft, MongoDB, Zoho, and FreshWorks.  


As we transitioned from servicing clients to solely concentrating on our product, we faced financial constraints. Remarkably, my team voluntarily chose to forego salaries, demonstrating their unwavering belief in our product's potential to transform SME's to a new era. Despite receiving lucrative offers elsewhere, they remained committed to building something we believe truly groundbreaking.

  
**(E) Our marketing plan, is this enough or should we talk in detail how we're planning to implement it?**  
Upon beta launch we're planning to focus on retail FMCG sector first and then double up sectors every semi-quarter upon success. Our proposed marketing road map involves a low cost high yield ideation split into three modes- hyperlocal ambassadors, language based regional social media engagements, and sector based.

  
I'm eager to hear your thoughts and insights on refining our pitch deck upon above points and overcoming our current challenges.
