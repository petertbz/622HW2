I rented with them recently (through work thankfully, so I wont be paying the bill) and had a terrible experience. I had an issue and spent 8 hours of my day just trying to contact a human. I ended up having to tweet at them to get a phone number directly to an office. Then when I brought the car back, the fees added up to 3x the cost I initially reserved the car for. They need to fix a lot of issues.","1"

This action substantially depreciated the resale value of Hertzs recently acquired fleet of used Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossovers.

yawn, so it was a price drop.. which has pretty much dick to do with the fact they are EVs. and basically cars they use for rentals, value dropped more than normal for a rental.

Im going to guess they replaced the CEO for other reasons besides he bought some EVs that are way cheaper to maintain.

But I think investing so heavily in EVs without testing demand was a huge blunder. Many people are not going to want to rent an EV vacation or a business trip because they don't want to or don't have time to wait an hour for it to charge, not to mention the detours of trying to find a charging stations. 

It was just poor decision making all around.","3_2"

My last vacation I rented a tesla from hertz for a few days, and it was definitely a fun and interesting experience to do once. But the annoyance of having to find a charger within a reasonable distance of the airport to recharge at (which there were none) made it a toss up as to whether or not they would charge me for returning the car at 85% instead of above 90%. The vehicles dont come equipped with a charging converter for some reason, so youre limited to the tesla superchargers instead of being able to charge at any given EV charger.

Thankfully they didnt charge me because the return agent knew the policy was stupid and relatively impossible to return the same way as a gas vehicle, plus the car literally immediately goes on a charger anyways upon return and has plenty of time before the next pickup. If there was one thing they could do to make it simpler for renters and more popular it would be to just make people return the car above 50% or something. 

Anyways the point is that while it was a neat experience to rent a tesla for a few days, I still picked an ICE car for my longer upcoming trip because its just so much easier without any of the charging inconveniences. Ultimately the hertz-tesla partnership works out better as a kind of test drive for people who might buy teslas than it does as a viable long term business strategy for hertz","3_2_1"

Things were decent when demand was low and inventory was idle, but when demand was high, vehicles skipped regular maintenance and repairs more often than not, at the direction (and sometimes insistence) of both branch and district management. I once even refused to rent out a vehicle because I felt it was unsafe, and made management put their name on it if they wanted it to go out so badly.

So a roof that should last you 20, even in Florida, has to be replaced because they won't insure you. Then when you DO finally make a claim after YEARS of paying premiums without a claim, they fuck with you for months. Then if they do payout, they often times will just choose to not renew your policy... 

The insurance companies that are crying about not being able to make a profit are simply used to the old ways of making 50+% profit and only having to pay out when storms come through. Even then, they will deny most claims because flooding isn't covered under normal homeowners, you need flood insurance. Or because your roof was too old, or a dozen other reasons. Not to mention that most policies have an ""act of god"" clause that can be enacted if they deem it so. 

Insurance is still a VERY profitable business. They just don't like having to actually pay out. I have zero sympathy for insurance companies. It's nothing but legal racketeering and they really don't have enough regulation imo.","2_1_1_1"

Insurance on an object you don't own yet makes 100% sense to me. 

I am not with you on this sentiment. Financed objects should be required to carry insurance. The lender is taking a risk lending you money and they want to make sure they get their money. If you total the car without insurance, you still have to pay the loan back. So requiring insurance ensures people can fulfill their end of the loan most of the time. 

You aren't required to have replacement insurance on cars you own. In most states if you outright own the car, all you need is a basic bodily injury policy.","2_1_4_1"

That means insurers are losing 10 cents on every dollar written on personal lines policies.

I'm an actuary who works in P&amp;C - The truth is the state regulators are getting in the way of actuarially sound rates, so the companies have a few choices: A) lose money or B) pull out of the state until the state allows them to charge what's necessary.

Hiring someone with no experience based on the raw gamble of I'm going to be able to train this person unproven in any way to make them into an effective, efficient and productive member of our team is a big risk, especially if you need to hire more than one person at a time. 

Now you may be thinking, well how do we reduce that risk during the hiring process? One of the ways is... By looking at past experience. I'm not saying it should be the sole determining factor but it's disingenuous to act like you can't understand why it's valuable. 

Something important to keep in mind is while most people picture these big corporations when they think of employers the truth is about 46% of US workers are employed at what's a considered a ""small business"".   In my job I'm part of the hiring process, I've spoken about it in past comments, and there are a ton of factors we have to consider when reviewing a candidate, the reason why past experience matters is pretty obvious. 

It's like a dating show where someone is weighing two suitors, one who's never been in a relationship in their life and one who's been in two serious relationships that didn't work out for reasonable reasons.

It is cheaper for me to hire my son as an employee at $80,000 a year then to give him that $80,000. As well as it helps him.

&gt;The hiring process itself, onboarding, training and the ramp up period with a new employee can be VERY expensive.

Hiring with the expectation to potentially fire quick is:

1.A huge resource drain in you're putting any actual effort into those steps. 

2. Going to be pretty inefficient when hiring people without experience who will need to be trained etc.

Basically the only way to do what you're describing effectively is the ""boiler room mass hire"" where you take on a group, give them mass training and then throw them to the wolves to produce with minimal oversight (as you cant provide low trainer to employee ratios in large groups OR if you do you have to have more trainers which adds to yhe resource drain) and then quickly terminate if they're not hitting desired KPI OR make them commission only to reduce the overhead.  This is also an experience people will not like. The problem here again is the only people who will typically be successful are the ones with past experience, which takes us full circle and you could have just hired off experience, given them focused training and gotten them to a point of high performance faster with less expenses.","2_4_1"

Employers will often not even train the staff they ALREADY HAVE, especially in the I.T. industry. Instead, they go to the job market, looking for someone who has those tech skills they want, then they hire that person and bring them in as a superior to the person who was already in the company, instead of simply paying for the tech training of their pre-existing employee. Then they act surprised when such employees accuse them of constructive dismissal and leave.   


Meanwhile, their pre-existing employee may just be a tech certification or two below what's needed for a promotion into that vacancy; a vacancy which has just been filled by an outsider who still has to waste a few weeks, or even months, getting comfortable with how the company operates.   


For such employers, their implied fear is that if they train their existing employees, making such employees more desirable to the open market, the employees will feel equipped enough to leave. But then people will leave jobs, anyway, if they feel they're being undervalued and treated badly. Consequently, I guess such bad employers are hoping that these half-trained or under-trained employees will be so scared of the job market, they'll stay in their under-paid, under-trained jobs (especially if the next logical tech training they need is too expensive for them to afford).   


In other words, employers are banking on employees remaining fearful and anxious.","7"

I think it's important to run your business as at least an S corp and actually pay yourself a wage. Then it's really easy to see whether your wage is larger or smaller than it would be elsewhere because, you know, it's a wage. Then you can look at how much money is left over after you've paid yourself a wage, what your assets may or may not be, and how much money is left over (if any).

But if you're living with your family and basically have no expenses and pour all your money into your business, it may be that you'll end up really successful. It may also be that you'll end up with nothing.

But sometimes it's difficult to get people to rationally see how much the business is actually worth unless they're paying themselves a wage.","1_1_2"

And because bookkeeping is its own occupation, and because starting your own company kind of requires you to move into that area, it can be difficult -- it adds an additional layer of complexity. And going to an S corp increases the level of complexity. But use that other subreddit as a starting point, ask around locally, and you can put some things together. Just start with an LLC, just use your name and say ""John Doe Trucking"" or whatever. Don't worry about an S corp in the beginning. But pretend like you're paying yourself. Transfer a ""wage"" to yourself, set aside money for the taxes you aren't withholding to pay estimated taxes throughout the year.

Don't comingle assets. Use a separate bank account for personal and business.

Ask around about good cheap (or free) software that'll help you be the owner of your own small business. You'll also want to look into /r/tax. Contact [VITA groups near you](https://irs.treasury.gov/freetaxprep/) now and ask how you can get trained to do other people's taxes and you'll start learning a little bit about business taxes when you get into the more advanced taxes (they'll be too busy to teach you now but will likely do some sort of training this summer or fall).

If you do switch to an S corp, you can even find software that'll do your payroll for like $5/month/person (and you're the only person).

I get a SHIT ton of owner operators calling in who are completely fucked financially. I find insurance gets A LOT OF them. Also even if they can pay those insanely high rates for the first year then often run into other issues like unprofitable loads, truck break downs, etc.

I have my MBA. This is the only good reason to get your MBA. But it's more than just networking...it's the network you ""buy"" with your MBA.

That's why it really matters where you get your MBA from...moreso than any other degree in my opinion.

An MBA from anything but a well regarded university/college is useless IMO. Get a BBA and read the Harvard Business Review regularly if you can't get into a better university/college. No sense wasting money on getting an MBA from a community college.

The only thing you want out of a MBA is a well paying job as soon as you graduate. If your university cannot provide you with that, either through their job placement department or through their alumni network, it's not worth paying the money for the degree. 

Tl;dr: no one really gives a shit about the MBA degree itself. It's too general a degree by nature for it to mean anything to recruiters. It's simply a means to an end to get a place on the bottom rung of the ladder. After that, your experience and performance will get you jobs from then on.","1_1"

For me, totally worth it. It gave me the skills to climb from manager to VP and now CEO. That wouldn't be possible with a Bachelor's alone, although some have done it. 


The school you go to affects your education and career prospects. My MBA program is among the top 20% in the nation. Not the best but definitely not the worst. Not ivy league but very respectable University.  


I know people from lowered tier schools and they're lost, they're not doing anything with their MBA. NOT THEIR FAULT, but it's just that these lower ranked schools didn't give them the tools and support to be successful. The academics are fine, but no school support. Which is to say, yes you can go to a lower ranked school but know that you're gonna have to do a lot more work on your own to be successful.


What kind of support?
A. A good MBA program needs to prepare you for interviews. Also provide leadership training.


B they need to prepare you for salary negotiations, including teaching you what is the average entry level MBA salary, so you know what to expect and ask for. Many MBAs from lower ranked schools don't know this and end up accepting very low paying offers


C networking, not just with alumni, but industry chiefs, industry juggernauts, government staff, and political influence


D  provide you with a whole ecosystem of attorneys, executives, accountants, image consultants, etc that you can take advice or coaching from


E self esteem and confidence booster exercises and activities by providing you with real world problems solving, interactions with industry executives, managing real non-profits, managing investment funds, etc where you can apply what you've learned. At my MBA program I was helping manage an investment fund.


F  Trips, galas, events, engagements, finance, conferences, mixers, etc. Opportunities to be exposed to the real world of business and industries, including at least 1 international trip.","19"

The downside to your strategy is its a longer term approach.

While youre smaller they can definitely counter this good people strategy with marketing.

Uhm. So there is an advantage in treating your ppl well. But having a sales backend is more important to actually make the numbers work.

Unfortunately you might just have to try them all to get a feel. A lot of times things that look like they will be amazing will have weird flaws that only become super noticeable after a little bit of time within the system also there is the mindset of the ppl on the lead sources to deal with. Like are they looking for the cheapest prices? Can you upsell them? Are ppl on this lead source more reasonable?

&amp;#x200B;

You might just want to try each one for a month and then you will know for sure. Ppl online tend to miss the subtle pain points of things like this. You might get lucky but I find that you have to get a feel for a new system or tool to get an accurate sense of the pros and cons.","4"
