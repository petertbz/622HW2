1. There is no $50 sandwich on this receipt. 
2. There are two \~$20-ish dollar sandwiches.
3. The sandwiches are 16"" sandwiches, nearly double a normal sandwich size.
4. It includes drink and paid for accoutrements.

Adding money in and of itself doesn't just magically make the existing money worth less. It devalues because people have more spending power and demand goes up. It is still a supply/demand issue.

The theory is that when demand exceeds supply, the cost of goods rises. Essentially, stuff goes to the highest bidder. This devalues the existing currency. Ie, inflation.

The problem we are seeing is more artificial inflation than anything else. Corporations expected higher demand than supply when covid hit, so they raised prices *ahead* of expected inflation. Except, the supply chain issue didn't affect all industries and many recovered quickly. On top of that, spending reduced because people were losing their jobs and struggling to make ends meet. So most were only spending on essentials. Meaning supply was not outpaced by demand. In moat sectors, supply was never outpaced by demand. The 1200 checks people got in the US never gave that much spending power to cause inflation. And the majority of the money added to the economy went to ppp loans that were forgiven. It went to big corporations that still sit on it today. They're not spending it. They're earning interest off of it.

Since the money didn't give anyone any real spending power, it never contributed to supply and demand causing inflation. Not in any real, meaningful way. Most of what we are seeing is artificial inflation and not because of printed money. It is specifically due to the expectation of standard supply and demand economics that never came to pass.

If it weren't for the corporate greed, we would have still seen some inflation, but not like we are seeing.","2_2_1_1"

If people expect 10% inflation, it really is no issue, everyone's wages would go up 10% like clockwork and we'd all move on; it's if people's expectations have no real anchor where things get painful, people don't know what to expect and so can't act accordingly.

For decades now, probably even longer, corporations change pricing based on expectations of economic changes, which in turn cause economic changes. They're not letting the market react accordingly. They're trying to stay ahead of it so that they don't take a hit. This creates inflationary problems where none should exist or, like in the current inflation we have been seeing over the last 3-4 years, severely exacerbate inflation that would naturally exist.

The inflation we are seeing is almost entirely created by corporate actions attempting to mitigate the negative impacts of inflation on their end, which shifts the bulk of the burden to consumers.","2_2_1_1_2_1"

Also, while consumer interest rates are up, markets are still outperforming interest rates incentivizing investments rather than savings. I think you were spot on that demand is increased as a function of the price people are willing to pay because free money creates misperception about its value. I also think that some companies have raised prices in an anticipatory manner, and never reduced when not justified. But the reality is we saw massive year-over-year inflation, month-over-month, for an extended period.

They were expecting to have to pay it back so they sat on it (barring the relative few that actually needed it). Once those loans were forgiven, they will put that money into buying back stocks or buying stocks of their subsidiaries or maybe even buy up other companies with it. They may ""spend"" it, but it isn't spent like consumers spend money. It's put in a place where it generates more income as soon as possible. It's not spent on consumption that would drive up demand and cause an increase in consumer prices.

Covid absolutely brought a seismic shift in spending practically overnight. Consumers were only rushing out to buy necessities and otherwise save their money in case they lost their jobs. Or maybe forced to save their money since they couldn't go out to restaurants and bars and such. So, while some markets hurt for supply, demand was, likewise, down. Not everywhere, but in a lot of sectors. I mean, look at gasoline. 

If supply and demand were really at play, gas at the pump would have been down to 80s and 90s pricing. Gas prices dropped, sure, but nowhere near historic levels. Even when pil companies were giving away unprocessed barrels of oil cause they had nowhere to store it.

The levers they pull to alleviate (or try) inflation is by running interest rates higher which affects all credit.

The hope is that you're unable to get credit, and thus won't buy things - but your company may be unable to get credit also, which means they'll lay you off, further diminishing your ability to spend which curbs inflation faster.

In a best case scenario for governments, high interest rates drive unemployment which curbs inflation, unfortunately this time around we haven't seen unemployment numbers go up at all or as quickly as they expected which is ruining the game for them.

It seems like there's a lack of production and many people believe that they can make money by investing, but where is the production? This is how prices inflate - through laziness. If you go to a grocery store, you'll notice that they aren't packed, but food delivery services like DoorDash are extremely busy( more inflated prices) There are many people who are unemployed or sitting at home buying products online and reselling them at inflated prices. There are also groups of people who scam ATMs, forcing more money to be printed and replaced, or who run retail theft operations just to sell the stolen goods online (which also inflates prices).

Eat like an immigrant. Get you some day old bread from Jimmy John's for like 50 cents a piece - not on the menu, but ask:""Day Old Bread"". Stop at your local grocery store and pick up whatever you need to make you sammies at a fraction of the cost. That's how the rich peeps stay rich and poor folks float. It's just not logical to spend $50 on 2 sandwiches.

Source: I married an immigrant. Thank God I did, otherwise I'd probably be broke, in debt from being a consumer whore, and not as grateful for what I have.

This is an old myth perpetrated by Austrian economists.  If money was tied to a commodity AND the reserves of said commodity remained static, this would be true, but we use a fiat currency.

Idk who needs to hear this, but prices are not set by some force that just exists like gravity.  Determining prices is not like finding the capacitance of a capacitor, where it is a physical result stemming fully from the physical characteristics of the capacitor (plate size, dielectric, distance, etc).

Prices are all set by the decisions of human beings.  The price hikes we have seen in recent years are not the result of increased demand.  Studies have shown that the overwhelming majority of price increases were just to increase profits - and not to cover higher costs.  This is why TVs and most non-essential goods have remained relatively unchanged.

Where are we seeing inflation?  On everything that is inelastic.  Food, clothing, housing, transportation, education, etc.  There is a class war going on and you're losing.  We're losing.  The centimillionaires of this country have seen their wealth increase by $8.5 trillion since 2021.  They openly stated that ""you will own nothing and be happy."" It's rather convenient then that owning anything is becoming more and more difficult, despite there not being a precipitous drop in supply...  

They flat out said what they were gonna do and they're doing it and people are talking about not buying food to get back at them or waxing intellects about economic theories that don't even have functional models... And having read a blurb and seeing talking heads on the TV repeat that nonsense over and over to viewers that lack the education to parse it doesn't make it true either...

China has been printing money, expanding their economy for decades and they're struggling with DEFLATION.  Japan has been juicing their money supply since the 90s and they have had inflation rates so low that they can't get a handle on it.  The models they work from aren't functional.

Meanwhile, Turkey and Argentina have had insane interest rates and insane inflation concurrently.... Why?  Because the cost of credit is reflected in the cost of all goods and services.

Whatever new costs are associated with doing business has more to do with the increase in rates than it does with a decrease in supply or an increase in demand.  What's left over is the decision of many many businesses to hike prices for profit margins.  This isn't complicated.

Until people understand that putting the ownership of everything we rely on in the hands of a tiny number of people is what causes these problems, they'll just keep doing it.","72"

Let's look at a competitor for fun; $5 footlongs at Subway, which ended roughly in 2012. CBI calculations (which are delusional bullshit btw, but what so many use as verification for their defenses) indicate the rate of inflation cumulatively from 2012 to 2024 is roughly 35%. 
That means your $5 footlong should be $1.35x5 by comparison. Every dollar you spent in 2012 is now expected to be $1.35 now in 2024. Clear? That's a $6.75 12"" sandwich. The current most generic footlong (Oven-Roasted Turkey) starts at $10.79.

That's a 115.8% increase.

How am I? Tired. Sounds like you are too.

Alright have a good day.","129"

They have raised prices 4 times in the last 12 months. A simple burger and fries used to cost $11.85, now going for almost $16. Cheese sticks used to be $6, then $8, now $10.85. A 16oz bottle of soda has gone from $1.50 to $3.

Decided to get taco bell instead and the only thing that hasn't gone up in price is the 4 drink special. Almost $75 on Uber. At this rate we won't be able to afford eat out at all. 

This is ridiculous","1"
