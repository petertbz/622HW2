Many people here are in a bad spot. Even the cost of groceries is out of control. Cooking a meal at home can cost almost as much as going out to the cheapest place to eat. I'm not even joking.

Unless you make repeated trips to Trader Joes or Costco for the bulk items, there's no weathering this storm.

We're talking places that have been around for 30+ even 60+ years. We've lost a lot of gems. Even fast food and corporatized food-product places have gotten the chop.

The only places surviving right now are really high end places that cater to the wealthy (who are doing better than ever) and ghost kitchens, as well as those little taco stands that set up shop on the sidewalks.

But again, it's LA... we have the extremes. The wealthy who are unaffected and the poor who might be hanging on by a thread because they live in crowded, rent-controlled dwellings.

I'm in an RSO building with 2 1 bedroom units occupied by 5+ person families.

No one is whining here, people are just trying their best to get by but it's cracking pretty badly here.

As someone finishing up school and trying to return to the workforce, I'm looking at pure hell unless I go back to doing what I was doing before college... or... the fucking reason I went to college in the first place... to stop cutting the bare minimum of wages.

The most money I've made in my life was $16 an hour back in 2011. 

But I guess I have to walk back into the wall of minimum wage shit given the state of the economy. 

You're not the only one struggling or who has struggled, so get off your horse. 

I'm not a crab in a bucket so I'm not gonna bring you down by saying ""suffer with us and like it."" I hope you find your ""out"" and improve on your situation.","10_2_1_1_2"

It looks like it is:

&gt;Burger King has seen three of its large-scale franchise partners declare bankruptcy this year. Both Meridian Restaurants Unlimited, which operated 115 Burger Kings, and Toms King, which had 90 locations, filed [Chapter 11 bankruptcy](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/b/chapter-11-bankruptcy) in the first quarter.  
  
They have been joined by Premier Kings, which runs 172 Burger King locations and has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. That followed a sister company, Premier Cajun Kings, which operated 19 Popeye's locations, filing for Chapter 11 earlier this year. Popeye's also falls under the Restaurant Brands International banner.

Of course this is a small sample size, but it gives you some notion of what is happening. Restaurant demand is collapsing, which makes restaurants close, thus making supply smaller, which culminates in higher prices.","10_2_1_1_3"

There has not been a major oil discovery since the 1970s.

The person who controls a resource controls the prices demanded for it, aka ""the law of supply and demand"", which, btw, is *NOT* any sort of natural law, but rather a justification for greedy exploitation. Restrict the supply, and you have a reason to charge more. Eliminate alternatives, you get to charge more. Deliberately fail to stockpile against disasters, you get to charge more.. Buy favorable legislation from politicians, you get to charge more.

Printing money doesn't cause inflation any more than fractional reserve banking does, they are identical, the only difference being who is creating the money and who benefits from it.

Inflation is caused by the *choice* to charge more in order to increase profits. The record profits posted by corporations shows that there has been no *necessity* to raise prices. The fact that markets have been monopolized by a few colluding agencies that has given them the ability to raise prices with impunity is the root cause of inflation. When the government gave out pandemic funds, the wealthy saw that as an opportunity to claim it via inflation. The public was merely a conduit used to transfer the cash, much like money put into Native reservations never stayed there, but was instead transferred to the local white economy, and didn't ever improve things for the reservations.

The ""supply chain disruptions"" were caused by poor management practices...the ""just-in-time"" model that relied upon perfect stability along the chain...that ensured that any event that caused a disruption at any point would multiply and magnify through the system, creating shortages that would justify price increases due to ""supply and demand"". It resulted in record profits and record wealth transfers to the billionaires.

No one *forced* them to raise prices, or to keep prices high after those disruptions were resolved.

Choices made by billionaires to benefit themselves, not the esoteric and undefined ""market forces"" so beloved by economists. Might as well claim it was the hand of God that caused inflation.","35"

I appreciate the additional details. If you're happy then stay in that mindset because that's already a positive. But in reality, in 2024 with how much inflation we've experienced and how much of it is greedflation from monopolies and deregulation and bailouts with our tax dollars, yes that is now shit wages where you will have to rent for the rest of your life (unless you have parents with a lot of money to help), and it's not your fault, but it's also silly to say that because of your anecdote everything is sunshine and rainbows in the US.  
  
You are young and living out in the middle of nowhere in presumably a very low cost of living area (not hard to find in bumfuck Ohio of all places), so I can't use you as an example to get a pulse on how *everyone* is doing, especially because when you're young you're just happy to not have to have roommates or be away from parents.  But 64k today is not what 64k was in 2020, and it's definitely not what it was in 2010, and depending on your career path I'd anticipate hitting a relative ceiling on that income soon.","54_1_1_1"

The idea is that people will spend less and the economy will slow down if their savings are growing faster, because putting off a purchase gives you more purchasing power the next day.

It's a moot and obsolete point because anyone today and automatically invest their paycheck into stocks/bitcoin/land or another deflationary asset and convert back to cash before a purchase easily with modern banking apps. So anyone that wants to can still choose to delay spending for that benefit, it's not longer at the whim of the fed.","1_2"

Just look at people with money.  They dont take the Fed seriously.  We havent had a system in ages almost where the conservative money wins and value investments does well.  Most of the money goes directly to the stock market and laughably in the riskiest and most bloated bets.  The wealth effect then takes hold and the money continues its funneling in the economy to bigger houses, and more consumption of fewer and fewer, richer and richer people.  This inequality is almost impossible to reverse unless the field of economics cant understand the basics like this simple idea.  Economics for a time was all about equaling the playing field.  The reality is its just another of a long list of fields now that makes the rich people richer.  Sure its understandable that the Fed almost needs inflation to negate all of the debt, but doing it this way historically ends in the complete collapse of economic systems.","1_1"

But you don't, that's the point.

When you give a bank a £$¬50 note and get a demand deposit balance of £$¬50 in return, you are exchanging one financial asset for another. You are swapping a claim on the central bank (the cash currency) for a claim on your commercial bank. They are different types of money, just denominated in the same unit of account: the state's.

From your commercial bank's perspective, they are accepting a claim on the central bank from you (cash currency) in exchange for issuing you their IOU (bank money in the form of your deposit balance).

The balance sheet positions for before and after you deposit that £$¬50 note:

**Before:**

You:

| 50 cash           |    0|

They are **different**. They are financial IOUs issued by different entities.

The government could (and imo should) insure 100% of people's bank deposit accounts (no person should lose bank credit in today's modern system just because a bank made poor investment or loan decisions) but that wouldn't change what I'm saying.

The same goes for loans. The old, incorrect view asserts that savers deposit cash with their bank, who go on to act as an intermediary by loaning out, say, 90% of that cash to someone else to earn interest.

That's **not** how it works.

In the act of making a loan, a bank **creates** the demand deposit balance used to purchase the resource (eg. a house or car). It is **not** reliant on deposits from savers in order to ""fund"" loans. The bank creates no broad money when it lends.

The reserves sitting in the asset side of the banking system, of course, are used to settle any payment instructions made between banks but reserves are **always** made available to banks for settlement **after** loans are made and are **not** a constraint on the lending process as the incorrect classical fractional reserve banking tale asserts.","2_1_1_1_1_1_1_1"

As an example of this cascading effect, California is the US's largest food producer by value, but the state isnt connected to the rest of the US via crude oil pipelines. Instead, california imports all of its crude from foreign countries, namely: Russia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Columbia, Venezuela, etc. as the largest food producer in the country. Disruptions in foreign oil trade will have effects on California food producers and thus affect food prices across the US.

But the disruptions in trade routes isnt simply oil. It's everything. By pulling out of afghanistan we have allowed russia and its ally iran to fund terrorism/piracy and attack main arteries for land and sea trade amid its proxy war with the US.
