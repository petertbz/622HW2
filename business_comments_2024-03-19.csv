In 2018 I went from 9-5 and 75k in student loan debt, to today 0 debt and making high 6 figures a year. And did it all making money on the magic interwebs :) This may be more info than what you're looking for but here you go :)

&amp;#x200B;

1 - Start a Service business: This is where I make majority of my money. 9-5 programmer turned freelancer. I make more money and have more freedom. What skills do you currently have? It can be anything: design, write, code, speak at events, or even organizing like a pro.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I've seen designing to be an especially profitable service. Check out the story behind the guy of designjoy.co (no relation to me). He's making bank as a 1 person agency. Use your existing skills (or skill-up) and start finding clients. Having a social media account to find clients I've found is the best way. So start being active on linkedin or twitter :)

&amp;#x200B;

2 - Ecommerce: one of my friends I've met while traveling owns an online jewelry store. She created some very basic jewelry (using CAD I believe) and started sharing it with friends and family. After getting some traction she opened a store on shopify, and cold outreached people. After a couple years she has merch in hundreds of stores, and she lives wherever (I met her in Bali). She started the business with like a couple hundred dollars, so definitely doable.

&amp;#x200B;

3 - Train yourself: This would be my top recommendation. I have an infinite budget for learning expenses (books, courses). I spend every morning reading content that helps me grow (stuff like trends.co and geekthegame.com ). After a couple years of this I feel miles ahead of where I was at. And the best part is most of the content is free! Learning marketing, and copywriting have been probably my top lucrative skills. Which says a lot considering I'm a programmer by trade.

&amp;#x200B;

The key here is to start small but think big. And remember, **its not just about making money; learning and growing will take you much further than anything else.** Good luck!","9"

1: you are a two-person team. That means you're limited by geography. Consider working on a simple website and SEO it, where anyone Googling ""your area lawn mowing"" and other related searches, returns your website in the search results. 

2: If you don't have the capacity to figure out the SEO thing, I would use my days off to canvas the entire working area and put advertising postcards in mailboxes or doorhangers on doorknobs. There are often local laws around this, so I would look into that. (If you want to be scrappy, local real estate agents do this same thing, and they usually follow all laws, so I would look into what they're doing with advertising.)

3: speaking of real estate agents, you can partner with a few (but not too many) to offer a free mow to new homeowners in the area you work. This allows you to let new customers sample your service without risk.

4: I'd also talk to property managers of larger buildings and properties. Just show up on one of your days off and ask for the property manager and chat for five minutes. No need for a hard sell; just introduce yourself and mention one thing you might be able to do better than their current service and then leave your postcard or doorhanger.","5"

You need to do a search and define what are small store. Are they 1-10 people, 11-50 etc. 

Very small store owners are not so much on LinkedIn, bigger companies who have 11+ employees might find them there.

This is one of the ways you can start if you see that in that platform you find the right audience. 

* Identify ideal customers, and map out your ideal countries. If it's US map-out states, that's where you see the biggest opportunity, like LA or so. Also, map out the people's job titles. On LinkedIn depending how active your profile is, you can add about 10-15 people per day. So focus only on the founders and owners of these small companies. Sales Navigator is a huge help, as there you can filter people by ""who posted in the last 30 days"" which is very important as these are the active people who I would start to add in the beginning. When you add people then be polite and send a note also, who you are and why you are connecting. 
* Optimize LinkedIn profile: clear background image, value-focused headline, compelling about section.
* Get 5-10 recommendations, to your profile if possible to build trust. 
* Engage with the LinkedIn community: comment on others' posts (10-15 words), and share value for free.
* Consistently post educational content or case study. Do not sell your product too much and share your story of how you make the furniture, why handmade is going away and how you can add the extra value people are looking for etc. 
* Connect with 5-10 ideal customers daily, personalized notes.
* Commit to LinkedIn at least 30-60 min per day for 3-4 months only then will results come. Add a lot of value to people as the only thing you do on LinkedIn is build trust with your audience.

TikTok has never existed in mainland China, though the app was available in Hong Kong until July 2020, when it pulled out shortly after Beijing imposed a controversial national security law in the city.

                    In March 2023, CEO Chew was repeatedly pressed by US lawmakers on whether TikTok was Chinese. He didnt answer the question 
                    directly, saying only that the app was not available in the country and that it was headquartered in Los Angles and Singapore.

The app is owned by TikTok LLC, a limited liability company incorporated in Delaware and based in Culver City, California. The LLC is controlled by TikTok Ltd, which is registered in the Cayman Islands and based in Shanghai. That firm is ultimately owned by ByteDance Ltd, also incorporated in the Cayman Islands and based in Beijing.

Chew added that 60% of ByteDance is owned by global institutional investors such as the Carlyle Group, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group, while 20% of the firm is owned by Zhang and 20% owned by employees around the world. Three of the companys five board members are Americans, he said.

                   That means the Chinese government now owns 1% of Beijing Douyin Information Service, which is the domestic 
                    Chinese unit of ByteDance.

Can Beijing prevent the sale of TikTok?
Yes, Beijing has the legal ability to do so and has already indicated it would.","5"
