With AI, most business models that do not require high engineering will be deleted, for example, porter class, logistics, cargo, delivery class, production and supply part. This huge job loss in the world will increase the unemployment rate and these unemployed people will have to somehow support their homes, from their point of view, they will starve because they cannot find a job, and from the point of view of companies, the supply-demand balance will be disrupted, there will be excess supply because demand decreases (if consumer has no money, no demand), this is a big problem for the company. I don't know what the companies will do in this situation. And for the governments they need to feed those guys to win the elections or they can use this as a leverage against competitors. In a game called Detroit: Become Human people were grouping against robots about the unemployment, there was a rebellion sort of.

So please keep that in mind, Im not trying to argue or debate I just want to learn. 

I was commenting on another post and a question came to me.

How exactly does credit/financing positively or negatively effect the overall economy? This might be a loaded question, please see following statement to see where Im coming from

If most Americans (apparently 56%) cant afford a $1k emergency without using credit, and we know that people, (because of credit) live well above there means, when does it start hitting the economy hard?

We are told by financial expert advice or guidance, someones rent shouldnt be more then 25% of there income, there car shouldnt be more then 10% of there gross income, and yet Americans are spending way more then those means. A $50k car should only be bought by someone with a salary of about 300k or more. We all know without financing and credit, cars wouldnt be able to be sold at that price as no one would be able to afford it.

With the cost of living rising, and wages not staying the pace, people are going to be spending fake money (credit) to be able to keep up with the economy. But when does the bubble burst ? How much credit debt, student loan debt, car debt, mortgage debt can the economy withstand before its over bearing that the expenditure just doesnt add up to what the average American family actually makes ?

 ***Photo above*** *- no . . . this isn't Karl Marx. Guess who it actually is . . .*

Wait  Marx predicted that iPhones made in China would worsen wealth inequality? And that would trigger end of capitalism? No way! If this is really true, then I'm going back to my land line. See link at bottom.

But Marx does seem to have predicted something, no? The richest guys on earth are all poster boys for extreme wealth inequality. And even the Americano ones have huge ties to in China.

**Elon Musk**  most days he's the world's richest man. More than half his cars are made in China.

**Jeff Bezos**  at least half the stuff for sale on his Amazon website is made in China.

Nine of the 10 richest guys live in the USA. In addition to Tesla and Amazon, they made insane fortunes with Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Google . . . The 10th guy is some cosmetics mogul from France.

In case you're wondering why there are no Chinese guys on the list, your worries are premature. There are at least 10 people worth $30 billion or more partying it up behind the Chinese iron curtain. In addition to owning the sweatshops that churn out our must-have western tech, these oligarchs also have huge stakes in TikTok, Spotify, food, clothing, and shelter. Even stupid stuff like Harry Potter online games. *It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live . . .* (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone).

**Back to Marx and Lenin**. Recent surveys suggest that 40% of voting age Americans identify as socialists. But to be fair, these are probably NOT people who have read Das Kapital or The Communist Manifesto. Those books aren't even in most school libraries. If such books hadn't been banned, people would have learned that the number one goal of Marx was to abolish private property. That doesn't mean just home ownership and farms, but also cars, smart phones, and videogames. What was Marx's second most fervent dream? To obliterate god - all gods, all religions. Which, in fact has been a trope of Russia, China, North Korea, Cuba etc. forever. There are conflicting polls showing how many Americans are now atheists, so I won't post any links here.

Let's set aside North Korea, which can't even keep the lights on, but is building ICBMs as fast as they possibly can. And Cuba, where they're also having electrical blackouts this week, and 400% increases in gasoline prices. And riots. Please let me apologize for prematurely predicting Cuban riots when Russia invaded Ukraine. It seemed obvious that if Putin stopped subsidizing Havana there might be trouble in paradise. I was a bit early, but it did come true.

Why is China rich, while The People's Democratic Republic of Korea, Cuba, and the (former) Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are all dirt poor? I'll let you in on a secret - China is dirt poor too. At least the people making our iPhones, Teslas, and our Samsung refrigerators. Samsung is a South Korean company, but they have a ONE MILLION square meter (25 acre) refrigerator factory in some Chinese province nobody ever heard of. Samsung TVs, smart phones, and dishwashers are all made in other factories, in other far-off places.

The minimum wage in China is 2,600 CNY (yuan) a month. Which SOUNDS like a lot, until you do the math. It's actually only $370 a month. That's $2.25 an hour, if you work 40 hours a week. It could be a lot less if you work 6 days a week, or more than 8 hours a day. I refuse to speculate further.

Is Chinese Premier Xi Jinping mocking Karl Marx? Or sowing the seeds of China's destruction? Marx warned the workers of the world to never give up their guns, because it was the last defense against corrupt, moneyed bourgeoise. Clearly gun rights didn't make the leap from the Communist Manifesto to The Thoughts of Chairman Mao.

**Today's column should NOT be construed as a polemic about iPhones, China, or the second amendment.** What should happen is that Americans  in this election year - should insist on an intelligent discussion on who our most favored nation trading partners should be, and how to rein in federal budgets that spend double what citizens are willing to pay in taxes. It's the economy, stupid! Let's discuss real issues instead of allowing the media and trolls to mesmerize us with stories about Trump's ginormous court fines, or Biden's latest tumble down the stairs of Air Force one.

I'm just sayin' . . .
