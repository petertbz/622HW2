   Yes, people should be smart with their purchases, but encouraging the general population to go take the only affordable toys left for poor kids really kind of sucks.   


  At the thrift stores now you see wealthier people with multiple shopping carts full of all of the nice toys and also the poor mom telling her son to put back a toy because they can't afford it. That's what is happening now because more are shopping at the thrift stores and causing the prices to increase making it so the poor kids can no longer have toys at all.  I have volunteered with the women's and children's shelter, the local charity thrift associated, in the free clinic that is partially funded by them.    


The more people who make thrifting popular among the middle class and wealthy harms the poor families who can no longer buy their kids toys and clothes  at all. The increased demand drives up the prices of thrift stores, so now even thrift stores are too expensive for poor families. ","1_2"

Instead of throw excess out, however, they can have people pick it up same day if they do a curb alert on Facebook. People will always show up to take it, they always do. 


Here, all the people who sort that at our charity thrift are volunteers, I have done so as well in the past. They don't hire anyone. Goodwill and for profit resellers hire people, but our charity thrift that supports our medical clinic, bill assistance program, housing program and food pantry here are completely run on volunteers. 


When they need more volunteers they just need to put out an APB in the community, into local church groups that they need help, and people show up. If they don't have the physical space to store whatever's coming in, they just do a curb alert or go to the buy nothing group and stated has to be picked up same day, and it disappears immediately. ","1_2_2_1_1_1"

Decorators and resellers here have driven up the prices at thrift stores so more people who are in genuine need are having to do without entirely now. Thrifts used to be the only affordable option for everyone in blue here: 


https://i.insider.com/5134dcdcecad048159000009?width=700&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp


You do have to keep in mind , if everyone stops buying new things entirely, there's going to be less donated to the thrift stores in the first place, so even less to go around.


When I took in 2 foster kids in 2021, I struggled to even find them anything at all in the thrift stores here but while there, there were resellers with multiple full carts in the checkout lanes of things that they needed. 


I honestly don't think people realize how little some even have ATM. I haven't even owned shoes for myself or chairs since 2021, yet I was taking care of kids not even related to me so they didn't wind up sleeping at the CPS office. 


I honestly do not think people understand the extent of the problems people are experiencing right now.","1_2_3_1"

The standard of living continues to go down for most of us year after year. Spend a little less on this and that, ""That will show them"". Apparently not. I'm curious to see how far down we have to go before people really get mad. I'm already buying essentials only, no vacation trips, no new clothes bought in the past 4 years except for socks and underwear, a couple used shirts perhaps. I cut my own hair, I do everything I can myself, auto repair, fixing stuff that breaks at home etc. I meal prep to save on cost, basically eating the same meal day in day out. I don't do anything but work, skip lunch and eat one or two meals a day, sleep and rinse and repeat. 

Is this it? This is worth doing for the next to 30 to 40yrs? I stopped going to the doctor too, the way I see it why would I want to do anything to help my longevity? For this type of life? I'll pass.

You want currency levels to **balance** the needs of the real economy. Its like oil in an engine: Too much and it overflows and catches fire aka inflation.

If you can make money by not spending it, nobody spends, our economy is based on consumer spending. There's more to it than that, but that's the simple version. It's why slight positive inflation is necessary for a healthy economy - it discourages hoarding cash

Incidentally there's a lot of interplay with the above idea and why higher taxes on the corporations don't necessarily lead to more revenues directly - but they do in the long term, because to avoid the taxes they spend the money on things like payroll or expansion or R&amp;D or whatever","17"

The Fed does do this at times, but in limited amounts as to avoid deflation. 

Deflation may sound good, who doesn't like lower prices? But when people start realizing prices are falling they stop purchasing all but the most needed goods. Why buy that new TV you want today when it will be cheaper next week and cheaper the week after that? This leads to a drop in demand for goods, which leads to reduced sales and layoffs. Higher unemployment leads to even lower demand and the cycle continues. Deflation even in small amounts can very easily lead to a deflationary spiral that will do far more damage to the economy than low to moderate inflation does.","28"

Therefore if it was used as the main money source for most of goods and services, the out come would be different.

1. Fed's interest rate.   Whatever interest Fed charge stay in Fed and not out for circulation.
2. When people/government paying off their debt.   Whatever debt you have, Banks likely borrow from the Fed then lend it to you.  ( except from deposit )     Let's say I buy a house and borrow 400k for a mortgage.   I use the house as collateral for 400k cash from a bank.   The bank use my mortgage and itself as collateral for 400k cash from the fed.    My 400k goes to the builder and the builder spent it on materials and labor.  That 400k is in circulation.   Inflation by an extra 400k

If I pay off my mortgage, the reverse happens.  -400k from circulation.

If today 5 eggs trade for 5 dollars trade for 5 apples... then I can buy 5 eggs from you with 5 dollars.  Then I quickly double the amount of available dollars so that now when you go to buy 5 apples it costs you 10 dollars.  Now 5 eggs cost 10 dollars as well.


As long as you trade things of value for dollars you are at the mercy of the printer.  It's why everything costs so much now, including housing and school.


But wait there's more... if we vote for policies that print even more dollars so we can fund things like 'affordable housing' or 'affordable college', we further reduce the value of the dollar so the result is that those things cost even more.


But wait there's even more... if you loan me more dollars since they are worthless (no space intended) then your exponential gains compound from the interest I pay, since higher numbers favor the lender.


And this takes us to the root cause that is not allowed to be discussed.  Lending leads to the problem we currently have, but it's only a problem for the borrower.  The lender had theirs in the beginning, and they have more now.

If they walk the tight rope and keep jobs going and inflation GRADUALLY coming down (this includes **ebbs and flows, where it ticks up a little and ticks down a little** \-- STILL FOLLOWING ME?)  then we can try to stick the ""soft landing"" where we don't get a huge recession and prices abate - albeit slowly.

Ultimately, the question is whether automakers will accept the reality staring them in the face and start making more small cars, or gamble on another bailout from the Federal Government.
