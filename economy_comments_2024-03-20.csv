White-collar crime is not treated the same as street crime in capitalist countries. In fact, some of the MSM articles written by the news agencies are sprinkling in statements like ""Amnesty International says Vietnam is secretive about its death penalty, and uses lethal injection."" And? The United States is secretive about what goes on in its prisons and also uses lethal injection.

[Example from AFP](https://bilyonaryo.com/2024/03/19/prosecutors-call-for-death-sentence-in-12-5-billion-fraud-case-involving-vietnamese-property-tycoon/money/)

&gt;...The country is notoriously secretive about its executions  carried out by lethal injection since 2013 instead of firing squad  but Amnesty International estimates that scores are carried out each year...

That sentence is designed to cast doubt on the integrity of the Vietnamese legal system, and by extension, on the proposed sentence, and could even be an attempt to get the reader to doubt the justice of punishing a tycoon.

&gt;...The case has shocked Vietnam and led hundreds to stage protests in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City  a rarity in the one-party communist state...

This sentence is designed to make Vietnam look like a failed state that is not responding to public concerns and needs 'freedom'.

&gt;...Lans arrest and prosecution comes as part of a nationwide crackdown on corruption, which has swept up senior officials and members of the countrys business elite in recent years...

This sentence is to make the reader associate the communist Vietnamese government with corruption.

&gt;...Alongside Lan, 85 others are facing charges including bribery and abuse of power at the trial in the southern business hub of Ho Chi Minh City. 

&gt;Eight are on the run, including two Chinese nationals...

This part is to make the reader associate this story with China. 86 people arrested for this fraud, 2 of them supposedly Chinese, and the article makes a separate paragraph to point out and highlight those 2 Chinese.

As is the part below:

&gt;...Lan, who is married to a wealthy Hong Kong businessman, is accused of creating nearly 1,300 fake loan applications between 2012 and 2022 to withdraw money from SCB, in which she owned a 90 percent stake...","1_2"

I really think it would be interesting to see how the VN media talks about our use of the death penalty.

Alabama tried to execute a poor guy recently and failed. So they switched to a new method and it worked on the first guy. But when they tried the second method on someone else it didn't work.

We all know exactly what they are doing: torture. It's so damn obvious. The corrections departments also try to destroy the bodies before autopsies, to hide the torture.

You even get these instances in the US where the victim's family completely forgives the person for their crime and begs the governor for clemency and the state executes the poor person anyway, as a matter of principle (since it is no longer about justice once forgiveness has happened).","1_2_1"

Machine translated:

&gt;...Lawyer Phan Trung Hoai said that defendant Truong My Lan was shocked to hear the death penalty request from the prosecution. ""The lawyers encouraged the defendant to calm down because he still had the opportunity to present and ask the jury to consider the nature of the level of behavior and handling in this criminal case,"" lawyer Hoai said.

&gt;The lawyer also said that recently, Chu Duyet Phan's daughter was given the opportunity to meet her mother. This is comfort and encouragement for the defendant.

&gt;Ms. Lan's defense includes 5 lawyers. The lawyers will proceed sequentially, after which Ms. Lan will exercise her right to defend herself.

&gt;According to reporters' observations Intellectual, after hearing the request for a sentence, Ms. Lan was standing and slumping into her chair, stunned. She continued to sit throughout the sentence request section with the remaining 85 defendants.

Pretty much anyone evenly remotely middle class who would get the death penalty if they were poor gets LWOP instead. At least in the US. The death penalty is mostly used to send a message to poor people. And a huge portion of the executions of poor people by the state don't go through the judicial system at all.

But at the same time, I wish we could send a message to the richest people that their crimes are real crimes and have real penalties. Even the rich people in country club prisons live better lives than many of their victims.","1_3_1"

Nobody is happy when when their expected lifestyle is downgraded.  My income is moderately above average and I have to be VERY on top of my budget, cook mostly at home, and do a lot of home repairs myself.

I feel I don't know if I'd call it 'hollowing out the middle class'. That makes it feel like it's some sort of nefarious intentional thing. I'm not that big of a conspiracy theorist.

But I do think that line of what middle class is keeps getting pushed back further and further. Rather than thinking it's intentional, I just think it's a string of bad American fiscal policies being implemented and a divided American government that would rather spite each other than help the middle class.","4_1_1_1_1_1"

I don't know of any first time homebuyers that bought a brand new home (unless of course theyre very wealthy, which aren't the types we're talking about). New and expensive homes are reserved for people who have the money to buy them... many of which who've spent years building equity. There are older affordable homes all over the usa. I'm in Northern Illinois west of Chicago. There are move in ready homes in towns all around me that are selling for less than $125k. Sure, it's not downtown Chicago, it's not LA, it's not Boulder, it's not Manhattan. It isn't glamorous and it won't make you feel warm and fuzzy like you're rich, but they are solid and sealed homes with plumbing, heat and air, and most importantly affordable.  




You don't need a new car. Hell, you don't even need a car loan. If you want to buy a house, spending thousands more than what a car is worth just so you can have something fancy is not money smart. Right now, I'm driving a 05 Subaru Forester with almost 300,000 miles. For work, I regularly drive 100 miles per day. I have all the faith in this car. I've had it for more than a year and have had zero unexpected issues. You can purchase a similar car in most markets for a couple thousand dollars. It doesn't have heated seats or heated steering wheel. It doesn't have the greatest stereo. It doesn't look like a new KIA (but will run longer). It isn't fast. But, it's reliable and gets good fuel mileage. The amount of young people I've met these last few years that complain they'll never own a home, yet owe tens of thousands on a car, is astonishing. A car loan is just throwing away your money and if you don't have much, it's nothing more than a flashy anchor.


No new jobs? Between the last 3 months, weren't there something like 600,000 jobs added to the market? There are decent paying jobs out there. Maybe it isn't exactly what you want to do. Maybe it's not glamorous. Maybe it's boring. But if it pays your bills and allows you to live a life outside is work, who cares? I'm in construction. It's dirty. It's loud. It's dangerous. It's either very hot and humid or very cold. I'm not a big fan of the work and it's no passion of mine. But, it pays me very well and affords me great benefits. It allows me to spend life outside of work however I want to spend it.


Sometimes in life, you have to sacrifice a want for a need. Nothing is perfect. I get it, 30 years ago, life was different. Many of you think it was easier. But, we don't live 30 years ago. We live today. It sucks, but you might not get everything you want out of life. But, do your best to do your best and you'll most likely do better than those that don't.

I agree. But, that doesn't mean all of those jobs are only in HCOL areas. Just like how there are affordable homes *not* in HCOL areas, there are decent paying jobs not in HCOL areas. From facilities maintenance, to construction, to HR, to janitorial, to factory or manufacturing work... there are good paying jobs out there, it's just many people don't want those jobs for whatever


Yes, there are unreliable used cars out there. Some people do get unlucky (but why are we pointing that out? You could do everything right and still fail. Pointing out people *can* be unlucky is a defeatest attitude and part of the problem i am addressing). There are also unreliable brand new cars out there. Anybody can educate themselves on which cars to look for and which cars to stay away from. That info is free and accessible on the internet. There's also a plethora of information on how cars work and how to buy a used car, what to look for and what problems exist. Considering the expense that vehicles are, it's a topic anybody would do well to educate themselves on. 


I think one of the main problems facing young people today is mixed properties. People are prioritizing a pretty car over a good car. They're prioritizing what they want to do for work, over what pays the bills. They're prioritizing the fancy new thing over the thing they already own that still works. They're prioritizing a HCOL area over what makes financial sense. 


I also think there's an issue of attitude. We are in a temporary economy. It changes constantly with time. Yet, people are absolutely convinced they'll *never* be able to own a home or retire, then spend their money like those things are never going to happen. It's only a matter of time before markets turn around for the better like they have multiple times in my and my parents lives. But, if you continue to prioritize your money on things you don't need (like a new car over a used car), then you really never will be able to afford a home or retire. The market will turn back around and those that are planning for it today will be the ones to capitalize when the time is right. 


While I agree with everything you've stated, I don't believe any of it points to anything wrong with my original statements.


My advice for anybody worried is to plan ahead. Take good care of your credit. Balance your budget the best you can and save as much as humanly possible, even if it's $25 per paycheck or whatever. There are first time home buyer programs that allow for as little as 2% down and closing costs can be negotiated. If you're ready when prices and rates come down, you'll be able to buy a home. ","17_1_1"

There's an entire subclass of troll on Reddit that makes a game of baiting you into saying something that'll get you banned on a subreddit.

I can say that being banned is SO easy. So easy. If anything can be deemed against ""the message"" you are gone. Just by talking about what DEI is doing to the movie business is enough to get one banned from the movie sub.

Rent is optional and not obligatory. If you want to get ahead and live in your car and use a PO box as an address, then do it. There are plenty of cheap housing in the... unsavory areas of the city, why not buy that house? If the city is just too expensive, why not move to a cheaper location?

A lot of infrastructure should never be privatized, or at the very least should have public options to compete with private price-gouging.

But those who benefit from privatizing infrastructure spend a lot of time, money, and effort demonizing public ownership, gaslighting the public into terrible deals, and creating artificial scarcity to maximize their own profits.

It takes a super majority to raise them and a simple majority to cut them. 

Yes, CA's pretty progressive by American standards, but, and this is key, *they've still massively cut taxes on the 1% as compared to top tax rates from the 60s and 70s*. 

And it's *very* difficult to raise those taxes. 

The point is to make a trap. Everyone votes for tax cuts doing good times, when times change and we need to raise taxes on top earners we can't because of how the law is structured. 

It's exactly what I said it is, a trap. It's designed to create excuses to privatize public services so the 1% can profit off them. Which leads to more economic pressure which is used as an excuse to cut taxes which becomes more cuts for the rich which leads to more shortfalls and on and on and on.

And you get the cheapest flights by booking in advance and avoiding peak seasonal travel.

There's even a beach town near me that has restaurants that are 50% off everything in the off season. Which means normal prices (it's double in the summer).

The question is whether we compress the season into a day. Should it be cheaper to eat at a restaurant after the lunch rush?

Some cities have dynamic tolls that are higher during rush hour, for example.

Ultimately, I think it boils down to inequality. If you get the big bucks, you can do anything you want whenever you want. You can smoke in elevators. You can park literally anywhere any time. The fines are trivial for these things. But if society doesn't give you a high income, you can't do certain things at all and there are some things you can only do some of the time or during certain times.

Society wants to use dynamic pricing to thin the crowd and create a better experience for the richest people. But we've seen this play out a thousand times. The rich people are already on a hedonic treadmill and have achieved their max happiness. So taking services and activities from poor people to give them to rich people only makes happiness inequality worse. We are sacrificing the extensive margin (the extent to which poor people can do things) for the intensive margin (the intensity of rich people's experiences).","2"

The FAA is fundamentally different because in their charter one of their many jobs is to promote aviation.

If you remember Trump, following the Freedom Caucus dogma of privatizing any public agency, wanted to privatize the FAA, not realizing that congress has given the FAA sole authority over the airspace.  No state, municipal or any other federal agency laws or any regulations, supersedes the FAA.  They manage both the  civilian and military airspace and are the sole and final authority. They are only governed by congress.

High tax States like California, has a Deficit, is in the RED.

https://calmatters.org/politics/capitol/2024/02/california-budget-deficit-balloons/

The reason for this is simple. High Tax places run off the business to low tax places, and those low tax, low regulation places end up making more money in the long run. This is called ""The Laffer Curve"" in Economics and it tells you the point where you raise taxes and regulation so high that it begin to negatively effect the economy.

&gt;If approved by parliament and the president, the legislation will allow almost 200,000 people employed in the sector to receive an additional 1,000 zloty (¬230) gross each per month starting from July. For those on the minimum wage, that would boost their earnings by almost 25%.

&gt;Social workers perform a difficult job that requires specialised knowledge and competences and they do so on a daily basis with full dedication and must be rewarded accordingly, said Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bk, the minister for family, labour and social policy.

&gt;

&gt;The measure will cover those working in the foster care and family support system, social care units  such as social assistance centres, crisis intervention centres and support centres  as well as childcare facilities for children up to the age of three  such as nurseries  that are run by local governments.

&gt;Over the last two years, I have very often met social workers in Polish local authorities. They are mainly women, with higher education, said Prime Minister Donald Tusk. He noted that they undertake very hard work but it is sometimes humiliating because they earn less than those they are helping.

&gt;He highlighted that an overwhelming majority are paid the [minimum wage](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/06/14/poland-plans-record-minimum-wage-rise/), which, as of January, stands at 4,242 zloty (¬980) per month. I insisted on preparing a solution for them, he added.

&gt;

&gt;The proposed bill would provide subsidies to local governments in order for them to make the extra payments to social care workers. Dziemianowicz-Bks ministry estimates that around 190,000 people working in the sector would be covered.

&gt;The bill will now be sent to parliament, where the government has a majority in both chambers. It must also then be signed by President Andrzej Duda, who is an opponent of the government but during his term in office has been supportive of measures to boost pay and social support.

&gt;I am counting on very quick work in parliament and a very quick signing by the president. I dont think he will be opportunistic here, Tusk added.

&gt;The policy announcement comes just over two weeks before local elections.","1"

Everyone was paid the same, so a Doctor did not make much more money than say a Baker making bread. Also food was rationed, so on Sundays you had the ""meat day"" and you would wait in a long line for a cut of beef, but it was free, just like everything else because the State owned everything and everyone was an employee of the State. So on certain days, you had ""Razer Blade day"" and you stood in line for razors, soap, whatever, on whatever day. They were a nation of ""line waiters"", waiting around for their ration of whatever.

So when we move back to UBI, a trick the Soviets did was they hid their wealth from the public, ya know, the Biden and Trump types, the Uni-Party types, but there it truly was the Uni-Party and there was only one official State party, the Communists, just like China. The Politburo had special grocery stores for the party heads because they were the only left making any real money. Those stores had more items than the regular public were allowed to buy, but still short of what everyone in the West normally had access to on a daily, hourly basis, no line waiting either.

I think the problem that Economists are worried about, was the Soviet system fell apart and UBI today looks just like that system, so it is destined to fail. The biggest problem however with all ""Gift based systems"" is that anyone who wants a little more can ""side hustle"" and that person will have more than others and they will get jealous and start complaining to tax them more, the same things you see today from the Snowflake Socialist wannabe's here in the States.

This article explains what happened with the Soviets and groceries for instance.

The US led the world in entrepreneurship because it had a very high abundance of natural wealth in the commons anyone (white and male) could claim, and abundant access to markets to sell too. It is part of the US identity. UBI is an entrepreneurship power house because it recreates that basic access to a common wealth, so people don't have to go through established private wealth to become a producer. And instead can get bought out by some giant corporation as soon as they prove they have a decent idea or talent.

Also we have many problems like homelessness, drug abuse, obesity and other diseases of despair; that our default solutions to are mass incarceration and spiraling healthcare costs that generally only treat the symptoms of. UBI will get ahead of those problems and prevent them from taking hold, and make it easier for grass root solutions to take hold of people already suffering. It will be the topic of 2025 through till we enact it around 2030, assuming Biden wins. If Biden loses, could be a country in Europe or Africa. The Kenya UBI test is the biggest and longest to date, and has been very successful; it is totally possible a country over there passes one before 2030.","9"

A significant swath of Americans now expect to spend almost 40 years in retirement, with about 1 in 8 workers planning to stop working before they turn 61. At the same time, most workers say they want to live until they're 100. 

That means some workers are eyeballing a four-decade retirement, an ambitious goal that comes with serious downsides. Among them: How to fund almost 40 years of retirement at a time when most workers are far from reaching their savings goals. 

The findings, from a recent survey from financial services firm Corebridge Financial, underscore the gap between Americans' lofty dreams for their golden years versus their financial realities. The median retirement savings balance for people who are between 55 to 64  just years from potentially stepping back from work  is $185,000, according to NerdWallet.

""100 is a very long and fulfilling life, and that's pretty optimistic and great to see,"" Bryan Pinsky, president of individual retirement at Corebridge Financial, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""That optimism and hope does come with a little bit of tension  only 27% are very or extremely confident that they won't outlive their retirement savings.""

Lets remember, the Founding Fathers didn't want a direct tax on the people and as a result, the States paid the taxes for the Fed, mostly in trade tariffs and that was a whopping 2.5%. So the USA saw 10% growth year over year with those low low taxes and regulations. The day we started the income tax and the day the USA started to find itself in ""World Wars"" and from then on, we have been sending our money overseas to watch it go ""Poof"". 

So you sitting around wondering why they are bringing in cheap immigrants and giving them rooms that they should be giving to our homeless and treating them better. Its easy, its because you keep ""Gifting"" them the money and they spend it on what they want, and that's private jets, weapons and cheap labor to replace you. Get a clue already will ya? Remember, YOU PAY THOSE TAXES, NOT THE RICH. They hide if overseas in the same numbered accounts your Ukraine money is in right now.

This chart says it all. You pay all the taxes today, and its been set up to trickle down to you in all circumstances, so ANY tax increase at all, YOU PAY IT!

If the inflation wasn't justified by anything other than the desire for increased profits, then reducing those exploitative prices would be good for the  economy by allowing the money to be saved, which is supposedly a goal, or invested, another good goal, or diverted away  from corporate coffers into local businesses.

Aahh, there, I see the problem: corporate profits will shrink and the extremely wealthy will suffer emotional distress. we can't have that, of course, they are too emotionally fragile. Wage growth is out of the question as well, since that is inflationary, too.

The usual arguments against deflation concerns a lot of nonsensical crap about people putting off buying stuff because it will be cheaper in the future. That ignores the reality that a very great deal of what people buy is inelastic. Food, for instance. No one can put off buying food for a month in hopes that it will be cheaper then. they can't put off paying rent.

The ""deflation is bad argument"" is about luxury items, not everyday necessities. Just because some things might suffer reduced sales, the slack will be picked up elsewhere. The money not spent there will wind up being invested elsewhere, creating demand and jobs. Oh, I forgot, to fight inflation economists think that the best method is to destroy demand by destroying jobs, so people can't afford to buys stuff, and then prices won't rise so fast. Makes perfect sense, right? Also, ""invested elsewhere"" means competition and no good capitalist wants that.

Food prices could easily be restored to pre-pandemic levels without hurting the economy, and corporations could be satisfied with less than record profits year after year. Deflation isn't the bad thing capitalist economists try to make out it is.","13_1_1"
